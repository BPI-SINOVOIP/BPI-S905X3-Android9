## 2.5\. Automotive Requirements

**Android Automotive implementation** refers to a vehicle head unit running
Android as an operating system for part or all of the system and/or
infotainment functionality.

Android device implementations are classified as an Automotive if they declare
the feature `android.hardware.type.automotive` or meet all the following
criteria.

*   Are embedded as part of, or pluggable to, an automotive vehicle.

### 2.2.5\. Security Model


If Automotive device implementations include multiple users, they:

*   [[9.5](#9_5_multi-user-support)/A-1-1] MUST include a guest account that
allows all functions provided by the vehicle system without requiring a user to
log in.

Automotive device implementations:

*   [[9.14](#9_14_automotive-system-isolation)/A-0-1] MUST gatekeep messages
from Android framework vehicle subsystems, e.g., whitelisting permitted message
types and message sources.
*   [[9.14](#9_14_automotive-system-isolation)/A-0-2] MUST watchdog against
denial of service attacks from the Android framework or third-party apps. This
guards against malicious software flooding the vehicle network with traffic,
which may lead to malfunctioning vehicle subsystems.
