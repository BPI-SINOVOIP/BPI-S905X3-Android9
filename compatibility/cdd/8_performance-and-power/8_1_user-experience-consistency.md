## 8.1\. User Experience Consistency

A smooth user interface can be provided to the end user if there are certain
minimum requirements to ensure a consistent frame rate and response times for
applications and games. Device implementations, depending on the device type,
MAY have measurable requirements for the user interface latency and task
switching as described in [section 2](#2_device-types).
