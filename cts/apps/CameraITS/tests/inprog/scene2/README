Scene 2 requires a camera lab with controlled illuminants, for example
light sources capable of producing D65, D50, A, TL84, etc. illumination.
Specific charts may also be required, for example grey cards, color
checker charts, and resolution charts. The individual tests will specify
the setup that they require.

If a test requires that the camera be in any particular orientaion, it will
specify this too. Otherwise, the camara can be in either portrait or lanscape.
