 * crypto library used by the TLS implementation is expected to be used for
 * non-TLS needs, too, in order to save space by not implementing these

 *

 * and one of these files is build and linked in to provide the functions

 *  COPYRIGHT (C) 1986 Gary S. Brown.  You may use this program, or
 *  code or tables extracted from it, as desired without restriction.
 *
 *  First, the polynomial itself and its table of feedback terms.  The
 *  polynomial is
 *  X^32+X^26+X^23+X^22+X^16+X^12+X^11+X^10+X^8+X^7+X^5+X^4+X^2+X^1+X^0
 *
 *  Note that we take it "backwards" and put the highest-order term in
 *  the lowest-order bit.  The X^32 term is "implied"; the LSB is the
 *  X^31 term, etc.  The X^0 term (usually shown as "+1") results in
 *  the MSB being 1
 *
 *  Note that the usual hardware shift register implementation, which
 *  is what we're using (we're merely optimizing it by doing eight-bit
 *  chunks at a time) shifts bits into the lowest-order term.  In our
 *  implementation, that means shifting towards the right.  Why do we
 *  do it this way?  Because the calculated CRC must be transmitted in
 *  order from highest-order term to lowest-order term.  UARTs transmit
 *  characters in order from LSB to MSB.  By storing the CRC this way
 *  we hand it to the UART in the order low-byte to high-byte; the UART
 *  sends each low-bit to hight-bit; and the result is transmission bit
 *  by bit from highest- to lowest-order term without requiring any bit
 *  shuffling on our part.  Reception works similarly
 *
 *  The feedback terms table consists of 256, 32-bit entries.  Notes
 *
 *      The table can be generated at runtime if desired; code to do so
 *      is shown later.  It might not be obvious, but the feedback
 *      terms simply represent the results of eight shift/xor opera
 *      tions for all combinations of data and CRC register values
 *
 *      The values must be right-shifted by eight bits by the "updcrc
 *      logic; the shift must be unsigned (bring in zeroes).  On some
 *      hardware you could probably optimize the shift in assembler by
 *      using byte-swap instructions
 *      polynomial $edb88320

// This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
// The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
// written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
// This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
//
// Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
// This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
// except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
// with every copy.
//
// To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
// MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
// needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
// will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

 * The Core Interface Layer provides basic services for accessing and
 * managing the DWC_usb3 hardware. These services are used by both the
 * Peripheral Controller Driver and the On The Go Driver.
 *
 * The CIL manages the memory map for the core so that the PCD and OTG drivers
 * don't have to do this separately. The CIL also performs basic services
 * that are not specific to either the Device or OTG modes of operation.
 * These services include all functionality that requires specific
 * knowledge of the CSR layout or the DMA descriptor (TRB) layout. Also
 * included are services for invoking each of the commands provided by
 * the DGCMD and DEPCMD registers (see the "Control and Status Registers"
 * chapter of the USB3 controller databook for details).
 *
 * The Core Interface Layer has the following requirements:
 * - Provides basic controller operations.
 * - Minimal use of OS services.
 * - The OS services used will be abstracted by using inline functions
 *   or macros.

 * Linux terminology for a Function Driver.)
 *
 * The Linux Gadget API is defined in the header file

 * in the structure <code>usb_ep_ops</code> and the USB Controller API is
 * defined in the structure <code>usb_gadget_ops</code>.
 *
 * An important function of the PCD is managing interrupts generated by the
 * DWC_usb3 controller. The implementation of the DWC_usb3 device mode
 * interrupt service routines is in pcd_intr.c.

  * This file defines the cryptographic functions that need to be implemented
  * for wpa_supplicant and hostapd. When TLS is not used, internal
  * implementation of MD5, SHA1, and AES is used and no external libraries are
  * required. When TLS is enabled (e.g., by enabling EAP-TLS or EAP-PEAP), the
  * crypto library used by the TLS implementation is expected to be used for
  * non-TLS needs, too, in order to save space by not implementing these
  * functions twice.
  *
  * Wrapper code for using each crypto library is in its own file (crypto*.c)
  * and one of these files is build and linked in to provide the functions
  * defined here.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
