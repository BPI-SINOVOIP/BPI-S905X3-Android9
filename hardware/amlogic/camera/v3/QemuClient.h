 * Qemu query
 ***************************************************************************/

/* Encapsulates a query to the emulator.
 * Guest exchanges data with the emulator via queries sent over the qemu pipe.
 * The queries as well as replies to the queries are all strings (except for the
 * 'frame' query where reply is a framebuffer).
 * Each query is formatted as such:
 *
 *      "<query name>[ <parameters>]",
 *
 * where <query name> is a string representing query name, and <parameters> are
 * optional parameters for the query. If parameters are present, they must be
 * separated from the query name with a single space, and they must be formatted
 * as such:
 *
 *      "<name1>=<value1> <name2>=<value2> ... <nameN>=<valueN>"
 *
 * I.e.:
 *  - Every parameter must have a name, and a value.
 *  - Name and value must be separated with '='.
 *  - No spaces are allowed around '=' separating name and value.
 *  - Parameters must be separated with a single space character.
 *  - No '=' character is allowed in name and in value.
 *
 * There are certain restrictions on strings used in the query:
 *  - Spaces are allowed only as separators.
 *  - '=' are allowed only to divide parameter names from parameter values.
 *
 * Emulator replies to each query in two chunks:
 * - 8 bytes encoding the payload size as a string containing hexadecimal
 *   representation of the payload size value. This is done in order to simplify
 *   dealing with different endianness on the host, and on the guest.
 * - Payload, whose size is defined by the first chunk.
 *
 * Every payload always begins with two characters, encoding the result of the
 * query:
 *  - 'ok' Encoding the success
 *  - 'ko' Encoding a failure.
 * After that payload may have optional data. If payload has more data following
 * the query result, there is a ':' character separating them. If payload carries
 * only the result, it always ends with a zero-terminator. So, payload 'ok'/'ko'
 * prefix is always 3 bytes long: it either includes a zero-terminator, if there
 * is no data, or a ':' separator.
