/**
 * Activity that handles system CALL actions and forwards them to {@link CallIntentProcessor}.
 * Handles all three CALL action types: CALL, CALL_PRIVILEGED, and CALL_EMERGENCY.
 *
 * Pre-L, the only way apps were were allowed to make outgoing emergency calls was the
 * ACTION_CALL_PRIVILEGED action (which requires the system only CALL_PRIVILEGED permission).
 *
 * In L, any app that has the CALL_PRIVILEGED permission can continue to make outgoing emergency
 * calls via ACTION_CALL_PRIVILEGED.
 *
 * In addition, the default dialer (identified via
 * {@link TelecomManager#getDefaultPhoneApp()} will also be granted the ability to
 * make emergency outgoing calls using the CALL action. In order to do this, it must call
 * startActivityForResult on the CALL intent to allow its package name to be passed to
 * {@link UserCallActivity}. Calling startActivity will continue to work on all non-emergency
 * numbers just like it did pre-L.
