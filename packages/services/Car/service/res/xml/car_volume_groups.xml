<!--
  Defines the all available volume groups for volume control in a car.
  One can overlay this configuration to customize the groups.

  This configuration will be populated by CarAudioService and
  surfaced to Car Settings App and/or other volume control interfaces.

  Certain constraints applied to this configuration
    - One context should not appear in two groups
    - All contexts are assigned
    - One bus should not appear in two groups
    - All gain controllers (set on each bus) in one group have same step value

  It is fine that there are buses that do not appear in any group, those buses
  may be reserved for other usages.

  Important note: when overlaying this configuration,
  make sure the resources are in the same package as CarAudioService.
