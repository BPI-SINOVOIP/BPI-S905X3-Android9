/**
 * Car UX Restrictions event.  This contains information on the set of UX restrictions
 * that is in place due to the car's driving state.
 * <p>
 * The restriction information is organized as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li> When there are no restrictions in place, for example when the car is parked,
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link #mRequiresDistractionOptimization} is set to false.  Apps can display activities
 * that are not distraction optimized.
 * <li> {@link #mActiveRestrictions} should contain UX_RESTRICTIONS_UNRESTRICTED.  Apps don't
 * have to check for this since {@code mRequiresDistractionOptimization} is false.
 * </ul>
 * <li> When the driving state changes, causing the UX restrictions to come in effect,
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@code mRequiresDistractionOptimization} is set to true.  Apps can only display
 * activities that are distraction optimized.  Distraction optimized activities follow the base
 * design guidelines that provide a distraction free driving user experience.
 * <li> In addition, apps will have to check for the content of mActiveRestrictions.
 * {@code mActiveRestrictions} will have additional granular information on the set of UX
 * restrictions that are in place for the current driving state.  The content of
 * {@code mActiveRestrictions}, for the same driving state of the vehicle, could vary depending
 * on the car maker and the market.  For example, when the car is idling, the set of active
 * UX restrictions contained in the {@code mActiveRestrictions} will depend on the car maker
 * and the safety standards of the market that the vehicle is deployed in.
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Apps that intend to be run when the car is being driven need to
 * <ul>
 * <li> Comply with the general distraction optimization guidelines.
 * <li> Listen and react to the UX restrictions changes as detailed above.  Since the restrictions
 * could vary depending on the market, apps are expected to react to the restriction information
 * and not to the absolute driving state.
 * </ul>
