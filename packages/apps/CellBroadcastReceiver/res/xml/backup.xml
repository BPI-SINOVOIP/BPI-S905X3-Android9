    <!-- This file is referenced from android:fullBackupContent in AndroidManifest.xml, and controls
         exclusions/inclusions for the default backup policy. -->

    <!-- Shared preferences files can be excluded using the "sharedpref" domain. -->
    <!-- Be sure to exclude any device-specific identifiers, such as the GCM registration key. -->
    <!-- You may also wish to exclude directories that contain device-specific session tokens or

    <!-- Additional domains include "file", "external", "root", and "path". See

         Additionally, content in the cache directory, external storage, and the no_backup directory
         (see android.content.Context#getNoBackupFilesDir()) are excluded by default. If you need
         to backup data in one of these locations, use the <include> directive. -->
