/**
 * A source of data for one or more columns in the annotated call log.
 *
 * <p>Data sources have three lifecycle operations, which are always called on the same thread and
 * in the same order for a particular "checkDirtyAndRebuild" cycle. However, not all operations are
 * always invoked.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #isDirty(Context)}: Invoked only if the framework doesn't yet know if a rebuild is
 *       necessary.
 *   <li>{@link #fill(Context, CallLogMutations)}: Invoked only if the framework determined a
 *       rebuild is necessary.
 *   <li>{@link #onSuccessfulFill(Context)}: Invoked if and only if fill was previously called and
 *       the mutations provided by the previous fill operation succeeded in being applied.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Because {@link #isDirty(Context)} is not always invoked, {@link #fill(Context,
 * CallLogMutations)} shouldn't rely on any state saved during {@link #isDirty(Context)}. It
 * <em>is</em> safe to assume that {@link #onSuccessfulFill(Context)} refers to the previous fill
 * operation.
 *
 * <p>The same data source objects may be reused across multiple checkDirtyAndRebuild cycles, so
 * implementors should take care to clear any internal state at the start of a new cycle.
 *
 * <p>{@link #coalesce(List)} may be called from any worker thread at any time.
