  //
  // -Numbers containing "#" or starting with "*" are considered service numbers
  // and are stored exactly as the user dialed them.
  //
  // -If a number is valid according to libphonenumber and can be parsed, this
  //  is the E164 version of it, with post dial digits appended.
  //
  // -Otherwise, it is the network portion of the number as dialed with
  //  non-digits removed, with post dial digits appended. An example invalid
  //  number is a 7-digit US number (missing an area code) like "456-7890" which
  //  would be stored as "4567890".
  //
  //  Note: Using this field without country_iso effectively loses country info
  //  when the number is not valid and no country prefix was prepended. This may
  //  cause numbers like {"456-7890", "US"} to be treated equivalently to
  //  {"456-7890", "DE"}, when they are not in fact equivalent.
  //
  //  See DialerPhoneNumberUtil#parse.
