/**
 * A drawer that is shown in one pane mode, as a pull-out from the left.  All the
 * implementation is inherited from the FolderListFragment.
 *
 * The drawer shows a list of accounts, the recent folders, and a list of top-level folders for
 * the given account. This fragment is created using no arguments, it gets all its state from the
 * controller in {@link #onActivityCreated(android.os.Bundle)}. In particular, it gets the current
 * account, the list of accounts, and the current folder from the {@link ControllableActivity}.
 *
 * Once it has this information, the drawer sets itself up to observe for changes and allows the
 * user to change folders and accounts.
 *
 * The drawer is always instantiated through XML resources: in one_pane_activity.xml and in
 * two_pane_activity.xml
