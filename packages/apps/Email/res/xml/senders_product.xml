        Email stores that are considered "universal" and are appropriate for *all* android
        platform devices should be defined in senders.xml.

        Entries that are device, product or carrier-specific should be added as overlays
        in the appropriate senders_product.xml file.

        Because overlays must correspond to an existing platform resource, this empty placeholder
        is included in the platform build.
