        Email providers that are considered "universal" and are appropriate for *all* android 
        platform devices should be defined in providers.xml.
        
        Entries that are device, product or carrier-specific should be added as overlays 
        in the appropriate providers_product.xml file.

        Because overlays must correspond to an existing platform resource, this empty placeholder
        is included in the platform build.
