Default Carrier Config App
==========================

This app works as part of com.android.phone.CarrierConfigLoader to configure telephony features 
based on the subscriber's network. It replaced many XML resource overlays in frameworks/base and 
frameworks/opt/telephony. The current framework allows per-network configuration that uses 
CarrierIdentifier objects, rather than just mcc/mnc.

This app uses a CarrierIdentifier to read the appropriate config snippets from the assets folder.

If you make changes to the XML files, run the unit tests to ensure they can still be parsed:
