# Specifications for keylines.
# * Any line beginning with a # will be ignored.
# * Empty lines don't matter.
# * Whitespace does not matter, commas are the delimiter. Don't skip commas, even if there is no
#   value in the cell. While it is easy to modify the script to handle a skipped comma, it is better
#   to enforce and error check rather than silently produce incorrect output.
# * Don't put a comma after the last value, if there is nothing in the last cell, leave it empty.
# * If a cell is left empty, the value for that alternate resource will get skipped. In that
#   case Android will use the best matching rule to determine the value. The matching rules
#   are specified at: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html
