This directory contains code associated with the "Time Zone Data" app, which is a mechanism
for updating time zone rules data on device without needing a full OTA: it is delivered via
OEM-specific signed .apk files.

The code/files beneath this directory are maintained by Android developers and intended to be
OEM-independent.

See the oem_template directory for files / directory structures that OEMs are expected to copy
elsewhere and configure.
