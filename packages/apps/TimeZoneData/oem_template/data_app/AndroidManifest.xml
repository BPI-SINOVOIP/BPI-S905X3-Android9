      OEM-INSTRUCTION: Change these to match the platform release the app is
      for and update for every platform release to ensure the app is only
      installed on the release it is targeted for. Typically, all values should
      be the same unless two Android releases use the same distro format
      version.

      Your app version code strategy and the version of the app included in the
      system image should be chosen to prevent older versions of the app being
      installed on newer Android devices.
      minSdkVersion will prevent newer versions of the app being installed on
      older devices.
      maxSdkVersion is not used by the device, but can be used by app stores to
      prevent the app being shown to users of newer devices.
