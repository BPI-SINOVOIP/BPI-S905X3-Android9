This is a non-regression test that reproduces a case where a local variable
would have the java.lang.Object type because of a null constant.
The type of the local variable would be transformed from "KNOWN_NULL" to
"java.lang.Object", but "java.lang.Object" wouldn't be added to the types of
the dex.
So in the rare case where java.lang.Object wouldn't be referenced anywhere else
in the compilation unit it would fail with "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:
not found: Ljava/lang/Object;"
