This test checks that we convert invoke-virtual calls to private
methods with invoke-direct calls.

The Zorch.class file is manually created by compiling Zorch.java
with java6 and manually editing the file to replace the opcode at
position 0xE9 with 0xB6 (invokevirtual) instead of 0xB7 (invokespecial).

This test compares emitted code against a known-good (via eyeballing)
version, so it is possible for this test to spuriously fail if other
aspects of conversion end up altering the output in innocuous ways.
