This test checks that SourceDebugExtension information propagates from
the class file to the DEX file emitted by dx. It extracts SMAP information
from the class file and DEX file and checks the strings match.

NB dalvik/dexdump does not have support for DEX annotations so the test
just checks that the SMAP string appears in the DEX file and assumes
it is packaged within an annotation.
