This tests the proper register preparation for invoke-polymorphic
instructions. The test was written as the invoke-polymorphic bytecodes
were mis-annotated in dx as having a return result. This led to a path
that did not emit the necessary move instructions and the generated
DEX file was rejected by ART. The issue was only visible when dx
optimization was enabled, but the problem lay in the OutputFinisher
register selection.
