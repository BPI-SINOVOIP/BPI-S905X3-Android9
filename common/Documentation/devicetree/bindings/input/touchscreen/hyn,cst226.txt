* Neonode infrared touchscreen controller

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "hyn,cst226"
- reg: I2C address of the chip
- interrupts: interrupt to which the chip is connected
- reset-gpios: reset gpio the chip is connected to
- x-size: horizontal resolution of touchscreen
- y-size: vertical resolution of touchscreen

Optional properties:
- irq-gpios : interrupt gpio the chip is connected to
- vdd-supply: Regulator controlling the controller supply

Example:

	i2c@00000000 {
		/* ... */

	hyn@1A {
		compatible = "hyn,cst226";
		status = "okay";
		reg = <0x1a>;
		reset-gpio = <&gpio GPIOA_5 0x00>;
		irq-gpio = <&gpio GPIOA_6 0x00>;
	};

		/* ... */
	};
