config AMLOGIC_TEMP_SENSOR
	bool "Amlgoic temperature sensor Support"
	depends on THERMAL
	default n
	---help---
		Thermal sensor low level support for thermal
		This driver parse thermal config data from device tree files.
		And register each cooling device for thermal framework.

		If you wan this driver, selest it.

config AMLOGIC_M8B_TEMP_SENSOR
	bool "Amlgoic temperature sensor Support for M8 chips"
	depends on AMLOGIC_TEMP_SENSOR
	depends on MACH_MESON8B
	default n
	help
		this config enables thermal driver for M8/M8baby chips.
		Say Y if you want this driver.

config AMLOGIC_GX_TEMP_SENSOR
	bool "Amlgoic temperature sensor Support for GX chips"
	depends on AMLOGIC_TEMP_SENSOR
	depends on ARM64 || ARM64_A32
	default y
	help
		this config enables thermal driver for GX/GXB/GXL/GXM chips.
		Say Y if you want this driver.

config AMLOGIC_CPUCORE_THERMAL
	bool "generic cpu core cooling support"
	depends on AMLOGIC_TEMP_SENSOR
	default n
	help
	  This implements the generic cpu cooling mechanism through reduce cpu core numbers.
	  This will be useful for platforms using the generic thermal interface
	  and not the ACPI interface.

	  If you want this support, you should say Y here.

config AMLOGIC_GPU_THERMAL
	bool "generic gpu cooling support"
	depends on AMLOGIC_TEMP_SENSOR
	default n
	help
	  This implements the generic gpu cooling mechanism through frequency
	  reduction. An ACPI version of this already exists
	  (drivers/acpi/processor_thermal.c).
	  This will be useful for platforms using the generic thermal interface
	  and not the ACPI interface.

	  If you want this support, you should say Y here.

config AMLOGIC_GPUCORE_THERMAL
	bool "generic gpu core cooling support"
	depends on AMLOGIC_TEMP_SENSOR

	  This implements the generic cpu cooling mechanism through reduce cpu core numbers.
	  This will be useful for platforms using the generic thermal interface
	  and not the ACPI interface.
