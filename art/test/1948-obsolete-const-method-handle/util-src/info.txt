This builds the class files for test 1948. It does this by first compiling the
contents of src/. Then it uses TestGenerator to add additional functions to the
TestInvoker and Test1948 classes. These additions are a new method that loads a
constant method-handle and invokes it in TestInvoker and functions that will
return the dex & class bytes for the redefinition that changes the target of the
methodHandle TestInvoker loads.
