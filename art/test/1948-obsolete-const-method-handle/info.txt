Tests that obsolete methods work correctly in the presence of const-method-type.

const-method-type and the invoke-custom/polymorphic opcodes are new in dex 39.
It is almost impossible to get them emmited from normal java code so we don't
have any coverage on them. To get this coverage we use ASM to build a class file
that contains the required opcodes.
