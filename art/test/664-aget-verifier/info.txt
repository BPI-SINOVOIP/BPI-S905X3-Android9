Tests how the verifier handles aget on an array that was initially null.

The verifier will flag aget instructions as have_pending_runtime_throw_failure_
if the array register is potentially null, even if the aget is guarded by null
checks and never actually null at runtime. This fails compile-time verification,
preventing otherwise good method from being compiled.
