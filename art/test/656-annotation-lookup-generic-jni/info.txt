Non-regression test for b/38454151, where the invocation of a native
method with an annotation (to be found in a custom class loader)
through Generic JNI would crash the Generic JNI trampoline because it
would throw an exception (that should eventually be caught) and walk a
stack with an unexpected layout when trying to resolve the method's
annotation classes (during the CriticalNative/FastNative optimization
annotation lookup).
