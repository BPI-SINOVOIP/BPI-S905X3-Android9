Exercise Dalvik-specific DEX file feature. Will not work on RI.

If these conditions are met:
* When we are loading in a secondary dex file
* and when dex2oat is not used
* and the dex file is stored uncompressed in a ZIP file

Then check:
* The dex file is memory-mapped file-backed as clean memory
(i.e. there is no extraction step)
