Tests ART synthesizes parameter annotations for implicit parameters on
constructors. Inner class and enum constructors may have implicit
parameters. If the constructor has parameter annotations, the implicit
parameters may not have annotations in the DEX file, but code that
looks at these annotations will expect them to.
