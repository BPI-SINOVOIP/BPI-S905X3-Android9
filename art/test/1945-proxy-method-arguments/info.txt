Test checking that reference arguments of proxy methods are visited as
thread stack roots when visiting Quick frames roots (b/73149739).
Previously, if the proxy method (direcly or indirectly) executed code
accessing one of these reference arguments in the proxy method stack
frame, it could end up with a stale reference, as the corresponding
object may have been moved by the garbage collector, but the stack
reference would not have been updated.
