Regression test for b/62237378

It was possible for the JVMTI class redefinition to encounter a use-after-free
bug if there had been an attempted redefinition that failed due to a
verification error in the same class loader. Actually encountering the bug
required that a later redefinition happen to get the same native pointer for its
dex-file as the failed redefinition.

Hitting this use-after-free can cause many strange outcomes, from CHECK failures
to segfaults to incorrect redefinition failures (for example on buggy builds
this test will fail a DCHECK on debug builds, segfault on x86_64 hosts and have
redefinition of LDexCacheSmash$Transform; erroneously fail with
JVMTI_ERROR_FAILS_VERIFICATION on 32 bit hosts).
