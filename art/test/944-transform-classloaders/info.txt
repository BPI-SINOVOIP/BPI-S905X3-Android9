Tests that redefined dex files are stored in the appropriate classloader.

This test cannot run on the RI.

We use reflection with setAccessible(true) to examine the private internals of
classloaders. Changes to the internal operation or definition of
dalvik.system.BaseDexClassLoader might cause this test to fail.
