Regression test for ag/853775

Tests that unresolved classes are not put into the dex cache by the verifier.
This was potentially happening when receiving a signal while in the static
initilizer of a class and also within a synchronized block.

This test is flaky and produces the issue rarely, but it should be good enough
to trigger occasionally with the buildbots.
