Codifies that the verifier should reject type-unsafe
instructions in dead code after aget on null, but pass
type-safe dead code.

Previously verification stopped after aget on null and
punted the method to the interpreter in an effort to avoid
compiler crashes. As broken code appears very uncommon,
ensure verifier strictness and help the compilers see more
code.
