/**
 * Constants for media control intents.
 * <p>
 * This class declares a set of standard media control intent categories and actions that
 * applications can use to identify the capabilities of media routes and control them.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Media control intent categories</h3>
 * <p>
 * Media control intent categories specify means by which applications can
 * send media to the destination of a media route.  Categories are sometimes referred
 * to as describing "types" or "kinds" of routes.
 * </p><p>
 * For example, if a route supports the {@link #CATEGORY_REMOTE_PLAYBACK remote playback category},
 * then an application can ask it to play media remotely by sending a
 * {@link #ACTION_PLAY play} or {@link #ACTION_ENQUEUE enqueue} intent with the Uri of the
 * media content to play.  Such a route may then be referred to as
 * a "remote playback route" because it supports remote playback requests.  It is common
 * for a route to support multiple categories of requests at the same time, such as
 * live audio and live video.
 * </p><p>
 * The following standard route categories are defined.
 * </p><ul>
 * <li>{@link #CATEGORY_LIVE_AUDIO Live audio}: The route supports streaming live audio
 * from the device to the destination.  Live audio routes include local speakers
 * and Bluetooth headsets.
 * <li>{@link #CATEGORY_LIVE_VIDEO Live video}: The route supports streaming live video
 * from the device to the destination.  Live video routes include local displays
 * and wireless displays that support mirroring and
 * {@link android.app.Presentation presentations}.  Live video routes typically also
 * support live audio capabilities.
 * <li>{@link #CATEGORY_REMOTE_PLAYBACK Remote playback}: The route supports sending
 * remote playback requests for media content to the destination.  The content to be
 * played is identified by a Uri and mime-type.
 * </ul><p>
 * Media route providers may define custom media control intent categories of their own in
 * addition to the standard ones.  Custom categories can be used to provide a variety
 * of features to applications that recognize and know how to use them.  For example,
 * a media route provider might define a custom category to indicate that its routes
 * support a special device-specific control interface in addition to other
 * standard features.
 * </p><p>
 * Applications can determine which categories a route supports by using the
 * {@link MediaRouter.RouteInfo#supportsControlCategory MediaRouter.RouteInfo.supportsControlCategory}
 * or {@link MediaRouter.RouteInfo#getControlFilters MediaRouter.RouteInfo.getControlFilters}
 * methods.  Applications can also specify the types of routes that they want to use by
 * creating {@link MediaRouteSelector media route selectors} that contain the desired
 * categories and are used to filter routes in several parts of the media router API.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Media control intent actions</h3>
 * <p>
 * Media control intent actions specify particular functions that applications
 * can ask the destination of a media route to perform.  Media route control requests
 * take the form of intents in a similar manner to other intents used to start activities
 * or send broadcasts.  The difference is that media control intents are directed to
 * routes rather than activity or broadcast receiver components.
 * </p><p>
 * Each media route control intent specifies an action, a category and some number of parameters
 * that are supplied as extras.  Applications send media control requests to routes using the
 * {@link MediaRouter.RouteInfo#sendControlRequest MediaRouter.RouteInfo.sendControlRequest}
 * method and receive results via a callback.
 * </p><p>
 * All media control intent actions are associated with the media control intent categories
 * that support them.  Thus only remote playback routes may perform remote playback actions.
 * The documentation of each action specifies the category to which the action belongs,
 * the parameters it requires, and the results it returns.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Live audio and live video routes</h3>
 * <p>
 * {@link #CATEGORY_LIVE_AUDIO Live audio} and {@link #CATEGORY_LIVE_VIDEO live video}
 * routes present media using standard system interfaces such as audio streams,
 * {@link android.app.Presentation presentations} or display mirroring.  These routes are
 * the easiest to use because applications simply render content locally on the device
 * and the system streams it to the route destination automatically.
 * </p><p>
 * In most cases, applications can stream content to live audio and live video routes in
 * the same way they would play the content locally without any modification.  However,
 * applications may also be able to take advantage of more sophisticated features such
 * as second-screen presentation APIs that are particular to these routes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Remote playback routes</h3>
 * <p>
 * {@link #CATEGORY_REMOTE_PLAYBACK Remote playback} routes present media remotely
 * by playing content from a Uri.
 * These routes destinations take responsibility for fetching and rendering content
 * on their own.  Applications do not render the content themselves; instead, applications
 * send control requests to initiate play, pause, resume, or stop media items and receive
 * status updates as they change state.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h4>Sessions</h4>
 * <p>
 * Each remote media playback action is conducted within the scope of a session.
 * Sessions are used to prevent applications from accidentally interfering with one
 * another because at most one session can be valid at a time.
 * </p><p>
 * A session can be created using the {@link #ACTION_START_SESSION start session action}
 * and terminated using the {@link #ACTION_END_SESSION end session action} when the
 * route provides explicit session management features.
 * </p><p>
 * Explicit session management was added in a later revision of the protocol so not
 * all routes support it.  If the route does not support explicit session management
 * then implicit session management may still be used.  Implicit session management
 * relies on the use of the {@link #ACTION_PLAY play} and {@link #ACTION_ENQUEUE enqueue}
 * actions which have the side-effect of creating a new session if none is provided
 * as argument.
 * </p><p>
 * When a new session is created, the previous session is invalidated and any ongoing
 * media playback is stopped before the requested action is performed.  Any attempt
 * to use an invalidated session will result in an error.  (Protocol implementations
 * are encouraged to aggressively discard information associated with invalidated sessions
 * since it is no longer of use.)
 * </p><p>
 * Each session is identified by a unique session id that may be used to control
 * the session using actions such as pause, resume, stop and end session.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h4>Media items</h4>
 * <p>
 * Each successful {@link #ACTION_PLAY play} or {@link #ACTION_ENQUEUE enqueue} action
 * returns a unique media item id that an application can use to monitor and control
 * playback.  The media item id may be passed to other actions such as
 * {@link #ACTION_SEEK seek} or {@link #ACTION_GET_STATUS get status}.  It will also appear
 * as a parameter in status update broadcasts to identify the associated playback request.
 * </p><p>
 * Each media item is scoped to the session in which it was created.  Therefore media item
 * ids are only ever used together with session ids.  Media item ids are meaningless
 * on their own.  When the session is invalidated, all of its media items are also
 * invalidated.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h4>The playback queue</h4>
 * <p>
 * Each session has its own playback queue that consists of the media items that
 * are pending, playing, buffering or paused.  Items are added to the queue when
 * a playback request is issued.  Items are removed from the queue when they are no
 * longer eligible for playback (enter terminal states).
 * </p><p>
 * As described in the {@link MediaItemStatus} class, media items initially
 * start in a pending state, transition to the playing (or buffering or paused) state
 * during playback, and end in a finished, canceled, invalidated or error state.
 * Once the current item enters a terminal state, playback proceeds on to the
 * next item.
 * </p><p>
 * The application should determine whether the route supports queuing by checking
 * whether the {@link #ACTION_ENQUEUE} action is declared in the route's control filter
 * using {@link MediaRouter.RouteInfo#supportsControlRequest RouteInfo.supportsControlRequest}.
 * </p><p>
 * If the {@link #ACTION_ENQUEUE} action is supported by the route, then the route promises
 * to allow at least two items (possibly more) to be enqueued at a time.  Enqueued items play
 * back to back one after the other as the previous item completes.  Ideally there should
 * be no audible pause between items for standard audio content types.
 * </p><p>
 * If the {@link #ACTION_ENQUEUE} action is not supported by the route, then the queue
 * effectively contains at most one item at a time.  Each play action has the effect of
 * clearing the queue and resetting its state before the next item is played.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h4>Impact of pause, resume, stop and play actions on the playback queue</h4>
 * <p>
 * The pause, resume and stop actions affect the session's whole queue.  Pause causes
 * the playback queue to be suspended no matter which item is currently playing.
 * Resume reverses the effects of pause.  Stop clears the queue and also resets
 * the pause flag just like resume.
 * </p><p>
 * As described earlier, the play action has the effect of clearing the queue
 * and completely resetting its state (like the stop action) then enqueuing a
 * new media item to be played immediately.  Play is therefore equivalent
 * to stop followed by an action to enqueue an item.
 * </p><p>
 * The play action is also special in that it can be used to create new sessions.
 * An application with simple needs may find that it only needs to use play
 * (and occasionally stop) to control playback.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h4>Resolving conflicts between applications</h4>
 * <p>
 * When an application has a valid session, it is essentially in control of remote playback
 * on the route.  No other application can view or modify the remote playback state
 * of that application's session without knowing its id.
 * </p><p>
 * However, other applications can perform actions that have the effect of stopping
 * playback and invalidating the current session.  When this occurs, the former application
 * will be informed that it has lost control by way of individual media item status
 * update broadcasts that indicate that its queued media items have become
 * {@link MediaItemStatus#PLAYBACK_STATE_INVALIDATED invalidated}.  This broadcast
 * implies that playback was terminated abnormally by an external cause.
 * </p><p>
 * Applications should handle conflicts conservatively to allow other applications to
 * smoothly assume control over the route.  When a conflict occurs, the currently playing
 * application should release its session and allow the new application to use the
 * route until such time as the user intervenes to take over the route again and begin
 * a new playback session.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h4>Basic actions</h4>
 * <p>
 * The following basic actions must be supported (all or nothing) by all remote
 * playback routes.  These actions form the basis of the remote playback protocol
 * and are required in all implementations.
 * </p><ul>
 * <li>{@link #ACTION_PLAY Play}: Starts playing content specified by a given Uri
 * and returns a new media item id to describe the request.  Implicitly creates a new
 * session if no session id was specified as a parameter.
 * <li>{@link #ACTION_SEEK Seek}: Sets the content playback position of a specific media item.
 * <li>{@link #ACTION_GET_STATUS Get status}: Gets the status of a media item
 * including the item's current playback position and progress.
 * <li>{@link #ACTION_PAUSE Pause}: Pauses playback of the queue.
 * <li>{@link #ACTION_RESUME Resume}: Resumes playback of the queue.
 * <li>{@link #ACTION_STOP Stop}: Stops playback, clears the queue, and resets the
 * pause state.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h4>Queue actions</h4>
 * <p>
 * The following queue actions must be supported (all or nothing) by remote
 * playback routes that offer optional queuing capabilities.
 * </p><ul>
 * <li>{@link #ACTION_ENQUEUE Enqueue}: Enqueues content specified by a given Uri
 * and returns a new media item id to describe the request.  Implicitly creates a new
 * session if no session id was specified as a parameter.
 * <li>{@link #ACTION_REMOVE Remove}: Removes a specified media item from the queue.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h4>Session actions</h4>
 * <p>
 * The following session actions must be supported (all or nothing) by remote
 * playback routes that offer optional session management capabilities.
 * </p><ul>
 * <li>{@link #ACTION_START_SESSION Start session}: Starts a new session explicitly.
 * <li>{@link #ACTION_GET_SESSION_STATUS Get session status}: Gets the status of a session.
 * <li>{@link #ACTION_END_SESSION End session}: Ends a session explicitly.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h4>Implementation note</h4>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of the remote playback protocol must implement <em>all</em> of the
 * documented actions, parameters and results.  Note that the documentation is written from
 * the perspective of a client of the protocol.  In particular, whenever a parameter
 * is described as being "optional", it is only from the perspective of the client.
 * Compliant media route provider implementations of this protocol must support all
 * of the features described herein.

     * <p>
     * Used with routes that support {@link #CATEGORY_REMOTE_PLAYBACK remote playback}

     * </p><p>
     * This action causes a remote playback route to start playing content with
     * the {@link Uri} specified in the {@link Intent}'s {@link Intent#getData() data uri}.
     * The action returns a media session id and media item id which can be used
     * to control playback using other remote playback actions.
     * </p><p>
     * Once initiated, playback of the specified content will be managed independently

     * <h3>One item at a time</h3>

     * <h3>Sessions</h3>
     * <p>
     * This request has the effect of implicitly creating a media session whenever the

     * has the side-effect of invalidating any existing sessions and their media items,
     * then handling the playback request with a new session.
     * </p><p>
     * If the application specifies an invalid session id, then an error is returned.
     * When this happens, the application should assume that its session
     * is no longer valid.  To obtain a new session, the application may try again
     * and omit the session id parameter.  However, the application should
     * only retry requests due to an explicit action performed by the user,

     *
     * <h3>Request parameters</h3>
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link #EXTRA_SESSION_ID} <em>(optional)</em>: Specifies the session id of the
     * session to which the playback request belongs.  If omitted, a new session
     * is created implicitly.
     * <li>{@link #EXTRA_ITEM_CONTENT_POSITION} <em>(optional)</em>: Specifies the initial
     * content playback position as a long integer number of milliseconds from
     * the beginning of the content.
     * <li>{@link #EXTRA_ITEM_METADATA} <em>(optional)</em>: Specifies metadata associated
     * with the content such as the title of a song.
     * <li>{@link #EXTRA_ITEM_STATUS_UPDATE_RECEIVER} <em>(optional)</em>: Specifies a
     * {@link PendingIntent} for a broadcast receiver that will receive status updates
     * about the media item.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h3>Result data</h3>
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link #EXTRA_SESSION_ID} <em>(always returned)</em>: Specifies the session id of the
     * session that was affected by the request.  This will be a new session in
     * the case where no session id was supplied as a parameter.
     * <li>{@link #EXTRA_SESSION_STATUS} <em>(optional, old implementations may
     * omit this key)</em>: Specifies the status of the media session.
     * <li>{@link #EXTRA_ITEM_ID} <em>(always returned)</em>: Specifies an opaque string identifier
     * to use to refer to the media item in subsequent requests such as
     * {@link #ACTION_GET_STATUS}.
     * <li>{@link #EXTRA_ITEM_STATUS} <em>(always returned)</em>: Specifies the initial status of
     * the new media item.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h3>Status updates</h3>
     * <p>
     * If the client supplies an
     * {@link #EXTRA_ITEM_STATUS_UPDATE_RECEIVER item status update receiver}
     * then the media route provider is responsible for sending status updates to the receiver
     * when significant media item state changes occur such as when playback starts or
     * stops.  The receiver will not be invoked for content playback position changes.
     * The application may retrieve the current playback position when necessary
     * using the {@link #ACTION_GET_STATUS} request.
     * </p><p>
     * Refer to {@link MediaItemStatus} for details.
     * </p>
     *
     * <h3>Errors</h3>
     * <p>
     * This action returns an error if a session id was provided but is unknown or
     * no longer valid, if the item Uri or content type is not supported, or if
     * any other arguments are invalid.
     * </p><ul>
     * <li>{@link #EXTRA_ERROR_CODE} <em>(optional)</em>: Specifies the cause of the error.
