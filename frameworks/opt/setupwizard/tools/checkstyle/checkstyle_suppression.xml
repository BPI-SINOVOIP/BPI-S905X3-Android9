    <!-- Note: Checkstyle puts the absolute path of files through the suppress filter, so the
         patterns below will match sub-directories. Notably, for overlays where the path is
         something like overlay/frameworks/opt/setupwizard will match the regex filter
         "frameworks/opt/setupwizard". This is probably OK for most cases since they are overlay
         of the original app and should have the same coding style. -->
