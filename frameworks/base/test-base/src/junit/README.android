This is JUnit 4.10 source that was previously part of the Android Public API.
Where necessary it has been patched to be compatible (according to Android API
requirements) with JUnit 3.8.

These are copied here to ensure that the android.test.runner target remains
compatible with the last version of the Android API (25) that contained these
classes even when external/junit is upgraded to a later version.
