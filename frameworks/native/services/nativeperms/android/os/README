IPermissionController.aidl in this directory is a verbatim copy of
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/os/IPermissionController.aidl,
because some Brillo manifests do not currently include the frameworks/base repo.
TODO(jorgelo): Figure out a way to use the .aidl file in frameworks/base.
