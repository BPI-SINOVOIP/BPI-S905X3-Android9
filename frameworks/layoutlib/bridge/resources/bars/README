The directory contains the resources for StatusBar and Navigation Bar.

The resources are not arranged as per the standard resources configuration.
They are stored per API. However, to prevent duplication of resources, each API
resource directory is used as a backup for all earlier API levels.

For example, for the back icon for ICS, we search first in v18, where we don't
find it, and then in v19.
