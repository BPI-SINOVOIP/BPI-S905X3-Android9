/**
 * Describes the playback status of a media item.
 * <p>
 * This class is part of the remote playback protocol described by the
 * {@link MediaControlIntent MediaControlIntent} class.
 * </p><p>
 * As a media item is played, it transitions through a sequence of states including:
 * {@link #PLAYBACK_STATE_PENDING pending}, {@link #PLAYBACK_STATE_BUFFERING buffering},
 * {@link #PLAYBACK_STATE_PLAYING playing}, {@link #PLAYBACK_STATE_PAUSED paused},
 * {@link #PLAYBACK_STATE_FINISHED finished}, {@link #PLAYBACK_STATE_CANCELED canceled},
 * {@link #PLAYBACK_STATE_INVALIDATED invalidated}, and
 * {@link #PLAYBACK_STATE_ERROR error}.  Refer to the documentation of each state
 * for an explanation of its meaning.
 * </p><p>
 * While the item is playing, the playback status may also include progress information
 * about the {@link #getContentPosition content position} and
 * {@link #getContentDuration content duration} although not all route destinations
 * will report it.
 * </p><p>
 * To monitor playback status, the application should supply a {@link PendingIntent} to use as the
 * {@link MediaControlIntent#EXTRA_ITEM_STATUS_UPDATE_RECEIVER item status update receiver}
 * for a given {@link MediaControlIntent#ACTION_PLAY playback request}.  Note that
 * the status update receiver will only be invoked for major status changes such as a
 * transition from playing to finished.
 * </p><p class="note">
 * The status update receiver will not be invoked for minor progress updates such as
 * changes to playback position or duration.  If the application wants to monitor
 * playback progress, then it must use the
 * {@link MediaControlIntent#ACTION_GET_STATUS get status request} to poll for changes
 * periodically and estimate the playback position while playing.  Note that there may
 * be a significant power impact to polling so the application is advised only
 * to poll when the screen is on and never more than about once every 5 seconds or so.
 * </p><p>
 * This object is immutable once created using a {@link Builder} instance.
