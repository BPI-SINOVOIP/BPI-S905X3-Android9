/**
 * A class for managing a single stream of input or output data from the camera
 * device.
 *
 * The stream has an internal state machine to track whether it's
 * connected/configured/etc.
 *
 * States:
 *
 *  STATE_ERROR: A serious error has occurred, stream is unusable. Outstanding
 *    buffers may still be returned.
 *
 *  STATE_CONSTRUCTED: The stream is ready for configuration, but buffers cannot
 *    be gotten yet. Not connected to any endpoint, no buffers are registered
 *    with the HAL.
 *
 *  STATE_IN_CONFIG: Configuration has started, but not yet concluded. During this
 *    time, the usage, max_buffers, and priv fields of camera3_stream returned by
 *    startConfiguration() may be modified.
 *
 *  STATE_IN_RE_CONFIG: Configuration has started, and the stream has been
 *    configured before. Need to track separately from IN_CONFIG to avoid
 *    re-registering buffers with HAL.
 *
 *  STATE_CONFIGURED: Stream is configured, and has registered buffers with the
 *    HAL (if necessary). The stream's getBuffer/returnBuffer work. The priv
 *    pointer may still be modified.
 *
 *  STATE_PREPARING: The stream's buffers are being pre-allocated for use.  On
 *    older HALs, this is done as part of configuration, but in newer HALs
 *    buffers may be allocated at time of first use. But some use cases require
 *    buffer allocation upfront, to minmize disruption due to lengthy allocation
 *    duration.  In this state, only prepareNextBuffer() and cancelPrepare()
 *    may be called.
 *
 *  STATE_IN_IDLE: This is a temporary state only intended to be used for input
 *    streams and only for the case where we need to re-configure the camera device
 *    while the input stream has an outstanding buffer. All other streams should not
 *    be able to switch to this state. For them this is invalid and should be handled
 *    as an unknown state.
 *
 * Transition table:
 *
 *    <none>               => STATE_CONSTRUCTED:
 *        When constructed with valid arguments
 *    <none>               => STATE_ERROR:
 *        When constructed with invalid arguments
 *    STATE_CONSTRUCTED    => STATE_IN_CONFIG:
 *        When startConfiguration() is called
 *    STATE_IN_CONFIG      => STATE_CONFIGURED:
 *        When finishConfiguration() is called
 *    STATE_IN_CONFIG      => STATE_ERROR:
 *        When finishConfiguration() fails to allocate or register buffers.
 *    STATE_CONFIGURED     => STATE_IN_RE_CONFIG:  *
 *        When startConfiguration() is called again, after making sure stream is
 *        idle with waitUntilIdle().
 *    STATE_IN_RE_CONFIG   => STATE_CONFIGURED:
 *        When finishConfiguration() is called.
 *    STATE_IN_RE_CONFIG   => STATE_ERROR:
 *        When finishConfiguration() fails to allocate or register buffers.
 *    STATE_CONFIGURED     => STATE_CONSTRUCTED:
 *        When disconnect() is called after making sure stream is idle with
 *        waitUntilIdle().
 *    STATE_CONFIGURED     => STATE_PREPARING:
 *        When startPrepare is called before the stream has a buffer
 *        queued back into it for the first time.
 *    STATE_PREPARING      => STATE_CONFIGURED:
 *        When sufficient prepareNextBuffer calls have been made to allocate
 *        all stream buffers, or cancelPrepare is called.
 *    STATE_CONFIGURED     => STATE_ABANDONED:
 *        When the buffer queue of the stream is abandoned.
 *    STATE_CONFIGURED     => STATE_IN_IDLE:
 *        Only for an input stream which has an outstanding buffer.
 *    STATE_IN_IDLE     => STATE_CONFIGURED:
 *        After the internal re-configuration, the input should revert back to
 *        the configured state.
 *
 * Status Tracking:
 *    Each stream is tracked by StatusTracker as a separate component,
 *    depending on the handed out buffer count. The state must be STATE_CONFIGURED
 *    in order for the component to be marked.
 *
 *    It's marked in one of two ways:
 *
 *    - ACTIVE: One or more buffers have been handed out (with #getBuffer).
 *    - IDLE: All buffers have been returned (with #returnBuffer), and their
 *          respective release_fence(s) have been signaled. The only exception to this
 *          rule is an input stream that moves to "STATE_IN_IDLE" during internal
 *          re-configuration.
 *
 *    A typical use case is output streams. When the HAL has any buffers
 *    dequeued, the stream is marked ACTIVE. When the HAL returns all buffers
 *    (e.g. if no capture requests are active), the stream is marked IDLE.
 *    In this use case, the app consumer does not affect the component status.
