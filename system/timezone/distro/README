This directory contains tools and code associated with time zone "distro"
files.

A distro file is a zip archive containing the files needed to update the time
zone rules on a correctly configured Android device, i.e. files required by
ICU4J / ICU4C / libcore and bionic libraries.

The .zip file also contains versioning information that can be used to prevent
a distro file being installed on an unsupported device.
