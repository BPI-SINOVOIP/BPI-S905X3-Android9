# This is the root build file for GN. GN will start processing by loading this
# file, and recursively load all dependencies until all dependencies are either
# resolved or known not to exist (which will cause the build to fail). So if
# you add a new build file, there must be some path of dependencies from this
# file to your new one or GN won't know about it.

# This pulls in main/BUILD.gn and all of its dependencies.
