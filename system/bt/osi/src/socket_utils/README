The sources in this folder re -
    implement some of the sources in libcutils / sockets to provide a short -
    term solution eliminating libcutils dependency from system /
        bt.Once a long -
    term platform - independent abstraction is presented,
    these sources and the corresponding headers should be removed.

        Note that only a part of the source files are pulled from libcutils /
        sockets,
    and"osi_" prefix is added to all functions
            .The developers who want to pull sockets sources other than the
                existing ones must put the sources in this folder and refactor
                    the functions as well.

        The current sources include :

        [Headers] -
        osi / include / socket_utils / sockets.h -
        osi / include / socket_utils / socket_local.h[Source files] -
        osi / src / socket_utils / socket_local_client.cc -
        osi / src / socket_utils /
            socket_local_server
                .cc

                    Please update the above list if adding more sources.
