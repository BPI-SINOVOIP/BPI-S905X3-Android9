   * to provide when a request comes in for data in the past (up to the maximum
   * buffer size for this source). This happens when numSamples at the source
   * sample rate is a greater amount of time than eventDelay. This buffer can be
   * released once cancelAudioDataEventRequest has been invoked for a given
