/*
 * We set an "exhaustion timer" to go off when we're ready for the test to
 * be over.  Then we exhaust the heap.
 *
 * We try a series of chre*() calls with the heap exhausted.  For many of
 * these calls, we're less interested in them succeeding than in the system
 * just not crashing.  However, for things which claim success, we require
 * they succeed.
 *
 * To track the things which claim success, we have two "stages", kTimerStage
 * and kEventStage.
 *
 * When the "exhaustion timer" fires, we free our memory, and make sure our
 * stages have all succeeded.
