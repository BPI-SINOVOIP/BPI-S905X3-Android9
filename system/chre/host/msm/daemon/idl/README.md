This file contains Qualcomm IDL files used with FastRPC. It is compiled into
generated code using the QAIC tool included in the Hexagon SDK. This generated
code is checked in to allow compilation of the daemon code without a dependency
on proprietary tools - use the update.sh script to regenerate the sources
whenever the IDL is changed.
