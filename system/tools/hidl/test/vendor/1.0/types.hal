 * @export is used to expose this enumeration in a C header using -Lexport-header.
 *
 * It should only be used to make a backwards compatible header definition so that
 * constant values defined in a .hal file can be used in a C library.
 *
 * export_parent below is used to test the functionality of export_parent. Typically,
 * you would only use it when inheriting from a parent type. Obviously if name is not empty,
 * then export_parent isn't required.
