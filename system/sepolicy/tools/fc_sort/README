fc_sort is a tool used for sorting the file_contexts entries based on a heuristic that is
 covered by a Fedora document. That document can be found here:
 * https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SELinux/ManagingFileContext

The tool itself originates from:
 * https://github.com/TresysTechnology/refpolicy

It can be updated to the current tip of master branch with the below command:
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TresysTechnology/refpolicy/master/support/fc_sort.c
