<![CDATA[
Users often want to communicate with emojis, stickers, and other kinds of rich content. In previous
versions of Android, soft keyboards (input method editors or IMEs) could send only unicode emoji to
apps. For rich content (such as images), apps had to either build app-specific APIs that couldn't
be used in other apps or use workarounds like sending images through the Easy Share Action or the
clipboard.

Now in Android 7.1 (API 25), the Android SDK includes the [Commit Content API][1], which provides a
universal way for IMEs to send images and other rich content directly to a text editor in an app.
The API is also available in the v13 Support Library (ver. 25.0), supporting devices as early as
Android 3.2 (API 13).

With this API, you can build messaging apps that accept rich content from any keyboard, as well as
keyboards that can send rich content to any app.
