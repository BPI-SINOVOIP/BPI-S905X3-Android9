        <intro>
<![CDATA[
This is an example of keeping track of individual touches across multiple
[MotionEvent][1]s.

This sample uses a custom View (`TouchDisplayView`) that responds to
touch events and draws a colored circle for each touch point. The view holds
data related to a touch pointer, including its current position, pressure,
and its past touch history.

The View draws graphics based on data associated with each touch event to a
canvas. A large circle indicates the current position of a touch, while smaller
trailing circles represent previous positions for that touch.
The size of the large circle is scaled depending on the pressure of the user's
touch.
