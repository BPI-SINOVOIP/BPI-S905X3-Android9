            This sample demonstrates how to transfer large files via Android Beam. After the initial
            handshake over NFC, file transfer will take place over a secondary high-speed
            communication channel such as Bluetooth or WiFi Direct.

            \n\nThis feature requires Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) or above. Unlike traditional Beam,
            your application will not receive an Intent on the receiving device. Instead, the system
            will save the file to disk and display a notification that the user can select to open
            the file using a standard ACTION_VIEW Intent.
