           This is a demo application highlighting how to make peer to peer network connections with
           the Wi-Fi Direct APIs.\n\nThe application allows you to transfer jpeg images from the
           gallery after a successful connection.
           The source code for this demo app shows how to accomplish three key things
           with Wi-Fi Direct APIs: Discovering peers, connecting using Wi-Fi Direct APIs, and
           finding group details post connection, so that a
           TCP socket can be opened to transfer files.\n
           If you are developing an application that uses the Wi-Fi Direct APIs, remember that the
           feature is supported only on Android 4.0 (API level 14) and higher versions of
           the platform.
