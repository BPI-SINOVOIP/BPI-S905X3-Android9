This sample demonstrates using the Camera2 API to capture a JPEG and RAW sensor frame.
Check the source code to see a typical example of how to display the camera preview;
run auto-focus, auto-exposure metering, and auto-white-balance; capture a JPEG and
RAW image for the same sensor frame; and save these into MediaStore for use in other
applications.

<![CDATA[
The [Camera2 API][1] allows users to capture RAW images, i.e. unprocessed pixel data
directly from the camera sensor that has not yet been converted into a format and
colorspace typically used for displaying and storing images viewed by humans.  The
[DngCreator][2] class is provided as part of the Camera2 API as a utility for saving
RAW images as DNG files.

This sample displays a live camera preview in a TextureView, and saves JPEG and DNG
file for each image captured.
