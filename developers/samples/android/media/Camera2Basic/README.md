Android Camera2Basic Sample
===================================

This sample demonstrates how to use basic functionalities of Camera2
API. You can learn how to iterate through characteristics of all the
cameras attached to the device, display a camera preview, and take
pictures.

Introduction
------------

The [Camera2 API][1] provides an interface to individual camera
devices connected to an Android device. It replaces the deprecated
Camera class.

Use [getCameraIdList][2] to get a list of all the available
cameras. You can then use [getCameraCharacteristics][3] and find the
best camera that suits your need (front/rear facing, resolution etc).

Create an instance of [CameraDevice.StateCallback][4] and open a
camera. It is ready to start camera preview when the camera is opened.

This sample uses TextureView to show the camera preview. Create a
[CameraCaptureSession][5] and set a repeating [CaptureRequest][6] to it.

Still image capture takes several steps. First, you need to lock the
focus of the camera by updating the CaptureRequest for the camera
preview. Then, in a similar way, you need to run a precapture
sequence. After that, it is ready to capture a picture. Create a new
CaptureRequest and call [capture][7]. Don't forget to unlock the focus
when you are done.
