This sample demonstrates how to selectively disable Automatic Backups in Android M, either by
adjusting the location where data files are stored using getNoBackupFilesDir(), or by using a custom
XML configuration file.

This sample can also be used as a utility to test the behavior of the Automatic Backup feature.
Executing "adb shell bmgr restore com.example.android.autobackup" from a terminal will cause the
sample\'s data to be cleared and replaced with a copy from the backup server.

This sample demonstrates how to selectively disable Automatic Backups in Android M, either by
adjusting the location where data files are stored using [getNoBackupFilesDir()][1], or by using a
custom XML configuration file.

This sample can also be used as a utility to test the behavior of the Automatic Backup feature.
Executing:

    adb shell bmgr restorecom.example.android.autobackup

from a terminal will cause the sample's data to be cleared and replaced with a copy from the backup
server.
