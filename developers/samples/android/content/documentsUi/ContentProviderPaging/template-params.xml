[ContentProvider][1] and [DocumentsProvider][2] now supports paging instead of fetching the all
data at once.

Starting from Android O, ContentProvider#query(Uri, String[], Bundle, CancellationSignal) and
DocumentsProvider#query(Uri, String[], Bundle, CancellationSignal) methods are introduced.
The Bundle accepts the keys for ContentResolver.QUERY_ARG_OFFSET as an starting offset and
ContentResolver.QUERY_ARG_LIMIT as the number of items included in the returned Cursor object.

Similarly, the returned Cursor object now has a Bundle object obtained by Cursor#getExtras().
The Bundle is able to include data such as the  total size of the underlying data set.
