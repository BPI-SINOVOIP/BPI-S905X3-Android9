This sample aims to help you understand the OPEN_DOCUMENT intent, which allows a client
application to access a list of Document Providers on the devices and choose a file from
any of them.

This sample first fires an intent to spin up the "file chooser" UI and select an image.
Then, given the content:// URI of the selected image, it shows it on the screen using a
DialogFragment. It also grabs metadata for the document specified by URI and logs that to
the screen.

To demonstrate this, click the "Show me" button to open up the Storage Access Framework
interface, and choose an image on your device.  It will be displayed in this app.
