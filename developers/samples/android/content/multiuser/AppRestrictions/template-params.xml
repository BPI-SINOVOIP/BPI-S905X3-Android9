This sample demonstrates the use of the App Restriction feature, which is available on
Android 4.3 and above tablet device with the multiuser feature.

When launched under the primary User account, you can toggle between standard app restriction
types and custom.  When launched under a restricted profile, this activity displays app
restriction settings, if available.

This sample app maintains custom app restriction settings in shared preferences.  When
the activity is invoked (from Settings > Users), the stored settings are used to initialize
the custom configuration on the user interface.  Three sample [RestrictionEntry][1] types are
shown: checkbox, single-choice, and multi-choice.  When the settings are modified by the user,
the corresponding restriction entries are saved, which are retrievable under a restricted
profile through the [UserManager][2].
