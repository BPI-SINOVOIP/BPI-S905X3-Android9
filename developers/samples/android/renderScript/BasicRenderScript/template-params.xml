            This sample demonstrates using RenderScript to perform basic image manipulation. Specifically, it allows users
            to dynamically adjust the saturation for an image using a slider. A custom RenderScript kernel performs the saturation
            adjustment, running the computation on the device\'s GPU or other compute hardware as deemed appropriate by the system.

[RenderScript][1] is a framework for running computationally intensive tasks at high performance on Android. RenderScript is
primarily oriented for use with data-parallel computation, although serial computationally intensive workloads can
benefit as well.

The RenderScript runtime will parallelize work across all processors available on a device, such as multi-core CPUs,
GPUs, or DSPs, allowing you to focus on expressing algorithms rather than scheduling work or load balancing.
RenderScript is especially useful for applications performing image processing, computational photography, or computer
vision.

This sample demonstrates the fundamentals of writing a RenderScript compute kernel, and using it to perform basic image
manipulation. In this case, each pixel is transformed based on a liner interpolation between its original
RGB value and it's luminance (black-and-white) value, weighted based on the user's specified saturation target.
