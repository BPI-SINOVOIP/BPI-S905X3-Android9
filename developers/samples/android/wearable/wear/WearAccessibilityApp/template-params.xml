             Intermediate is for content that covers material a beginner doesn't need
             to know, but that a skilled developer is expected to know.
             (e.g. services, basic styles and theming, sync adapters)

             Advanced is for highly technical content geared towards experienced developers.
             (e.g. performance optimizations, custom views, bluetooth)

             Expert is reserved for highly technical or specialized content, and should
             be used sparingly. (e.g. VPN clients, SELinux, custom instrumentation runners) -->

        <intro>
            Accessibility is an important part of any app (especially wearable apps). By
            integrating accessible components and services, you can improve your app's usability,
            particularly for users with disabilities.

            This sample demonstrates common UX patterns in wearable apps along with accessibility
            support of those patterns. Be sure to review the [Accessibility Developer Checklist][1]
            for your own app. For additional information please see our
            [Best Practices for User Interface][2] page.
