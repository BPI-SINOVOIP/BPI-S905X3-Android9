In order to run this application, you need to install the
wearable apk on a device that has GPS capabilities in
hardware. In addition, you need to obtain an API key for
using Map v2 APIs, see the following link for the details:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get_an_android_certificate_and_the_google_maps_api_key
After getting the key, find the following line in
Application/src/main/res/values/strings.xml:

<string name="map_v2_api_key">YOUR_MAP_V2_API_KEY</string>

and replace YOUR_MAP_V2_API_KEY with your own key.
