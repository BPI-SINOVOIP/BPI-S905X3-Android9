            Demonstrates how to create a DelayedConfirmationView in your wearable app. In this
            sample, pressing a button on the phone app sends a message to the wearable to start a simple
            activity. This activity displays a DelayedConfirmationView that starts when the user presses "Start
            Timer." Then, callbacks are implemented on both the wearable and phone to show when the timer is
            selected or finishes. The activity on the wearable uses BoxInsetLayout to automatically apply
            appropriate margins based on whether the display is square or circular.
