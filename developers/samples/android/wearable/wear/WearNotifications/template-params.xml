            Sample demonstrates best practices for Notification Styles that support Android
            phone/tablets and Wear. The phone app demonstrates best practices if you
            do not have a dedicated Wear app for Notifications. While the Wear app
            demonstrates best practices for a standalone Wear Notification experience without
            the Notifications showing on the phone/tablet.

            Sample demonstrates best practices for using NotificationStyle Notifications (Inbox,
            BigPicture, BigText, and Messaging) for both Mobile apps and native/local Wear
            apps. It also covers Notifications on Wear 1.+ and Wear 2.0.

<![CDATA[
Steps for trying out the sample:
* Compile and install the mobile app onto your mobile device or emulator (for mobile
scenario).
* Compile and install the wearable app onto your Wear device or emulator (for Wear
scenario).

This sample demonstrate best practices for using [NotificationStyle][1]
[Notifications][2] for two scenarios:

1. Launching Notifications from a Mobile app WITHOUT a native Wear app.
Notifications appear both on mobile and Wear (bridged to appear like a local/native
Wear app).

2. Launching Notifications from a Native/Local Wear app. Notifications only
appear on Wear device.

The Mobile and Wear apps demonstrate [BigTextStyle][3], [BigPictureStyle][4],
[InboxStyle][5], and [MessagingStyle][6] Notifications.

Although there are two apps (Mobile and Wear) running, each should be looked at as a
separate experience. That is, neither app uses nor relies on the other.

They are packaged together simply to show both scenarios in one easy sample.

Both apps also cover the Notifications being displayed on Wear 1.+ and/or Wear 2.0 and
using some of the new features of Wear 2.0 (inline actions).
