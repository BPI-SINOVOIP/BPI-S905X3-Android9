Android BasicAndroidKeyStore Sample
===================================

An advanced sample displaying the creation and usage of data integrity mechanisms

Introduction
------------

This sample demonstrates how to use the Android [KeyStore][1] to safely create and store
encryption keys that only your application can access.

A [KeyPair][2] consisting of a [PrivateKey][3] and a [PublicKey][4] is being generated.
The private key then is being used to sign and verify a String.

Next to that appropriate exception handling for potential errors is being displayed.
