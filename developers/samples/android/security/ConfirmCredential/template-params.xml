            <![CDATA[
This sample demonstrates how you can use device credentials (PIN, Pattern, Password) in your app
to authenticate the user before they are trying to complete some actions.

First you need to create a symmetric key in the Android Key Store using [KeyGenerator][1]
which can be only be used after the user has authenticated after the user is authenticated
with their device credentials and pass [KeyGenParameterSpec][2].

By setting an integer value to the
[KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder.setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds][3], you can consider the
user as authenticated if the user has been authenticated with the device credentials
within the last x seconds.

Then by calling [KeyguardManager.createConfirmDeviceCredentialIntent][4], you can show a screen
to confirm device credentials to the user.
