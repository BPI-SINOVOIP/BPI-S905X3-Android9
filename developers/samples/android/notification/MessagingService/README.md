Android MessagingService Sample
===================================

This sample shows a simple service that sends notifications using
NotificationCompat. It also extends the notification with Remote
Input to allow Android N devices to reply via text directly from
the notification without having to open an App. The same Remote
Input object also allows Android Auto users to respond by voice
when the notification is presented there.
Note: Each unread conversation from a user is sent as a distinct
notification.

Introduction
------------

#### Checklist while building a messaging app that supports Android Auto:
1. Ensure that Message notifications are extended using
NotificationCompat.Builder.extend(new CarExtender()...)
2. Declare a meta-data tag to your AndroidManifest.xml to specify that your app
is automotive enabled.

example: AndroidManifest.xml

```
       <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.car.application"
                   android:resource="@xml/automotive_app_desc"/>
```

Include the following to indicate that the application wants to show notifications on
the Android Auto overview screen.

example: res/xml/automotive\_app\_desc.xml
```
        <automotiveApp>
            <uses name="notification"/>
        </automotiveApp>
```

#### Flow
MessagingFragment is shown to the user. Depending on the button clicked, the MessagingService is
sent a message. MessagingService in turn creates notifications which can be viewed either on the
device or in the messaging-simulator.

When a message is read, the associated PendingIntent is triggered and MessageReadReceiver is called
with the appropriate conversationId. Similarly, when a reply is received, the MessageReplyReceiver
is called with the appropriate conversationId. MessageLogger logs each event and shows them in a
TextView in MessagingFragment for correlation.
