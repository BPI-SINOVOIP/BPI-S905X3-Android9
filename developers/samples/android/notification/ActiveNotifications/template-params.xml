Notifications can now be grouped in Android N. Since Android M, the
NotificationManager can tell you how many notifications your application
is currently showing. This sample demonstrates how to use these APIs
together for a nicer user experience when an app may have multiple
notifications. To get started, press the "add a notification" button.
If you add more than one notification a notification summary will be
added. When a notification is being canceled, the count gets updated
via a PendingIntent.

Notification Groups and the Notification Manager can be used together to simplify
how users experience notifications. This sample demonstrates how
the NotificationManager can tell you how many notifications your
application is currently showing. It also shows how to manage the
notifications as a group and introduce a summary for the group, when
supported by the platform.

Notifications can now be grouped.

Starting with Android N, you can set notification groups for notifications
and define a notification group summary.

In Android M, you can query for the active notifications that your app sent
sing the [notify][2] methods.

This sample demonstrates simple use of these features by allowing a user
to add notifications and then query how many notifications
are currently being displayed via the [getActiveNotifications()][3] method.
