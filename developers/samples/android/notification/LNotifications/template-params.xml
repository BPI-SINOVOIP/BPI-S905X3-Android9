<![CDATA[
Android 5.0 (Lollipop, API level 21) introduced additional features to the Notification API.
Specifically, it allows developers to specify the priority and visibility level for
notifications. This metadata allows the system to provide enhanced security for notifications
while the lock screen is active, allows high-priority notifications to appear even when
the notification bar is closed, and provides users to silence low-priority notifications
when they're busy.

This metadata is provided via additional arguments to the `Notification.Builder` class.

Specifically, this sample demonstrates how to generate a heads-up notification
(`HeadsUpNotificationFragment`), how to control visibility on the lock screen
(`VisibilityMetadataFragment`), and how to set the category, priority, and associated contact
for a notification (`OtherMetadataFragment`).
