Android SwipeRefreshListFragment Sample
===================================

A sample which shows how to use `SwipeRefreshLayout` to add
'swipe-to-refresh' gesture to a ListView, enabling the ability to trigger a refresh
from swiping down on that view.

Introduction
------------

A sample which shows how to use
[SwipeRefreshLayout][1] within a `ListFragment` to add the 'swipe-to-refresh'
gesture to a `ListView`. The sample provides this functionality by defining a
re-usable `SwipeRefreshListFragment` class.

The sample displays a list of cheeses. When the user initiates a downward swipe,
that list refreshes with randomly generated items. Selecting the `Refresh`
action from the action bar also refreshes the list.
