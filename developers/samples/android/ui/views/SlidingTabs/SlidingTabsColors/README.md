Android SlidingTabsColors Sample
===================================

A more advanced sample which shows how to use SlidingTabLayout to display a custom
ViewPager title strip, with custom coloring for each tab.

Introduction
------------

This sample consists of a custom [HorizontalScrollView][1] called `SlidingTabLayout` that is used
with a [ViewPager][2] to provide a tab indicator component which gives constant feedback as to
the user's scroll progress.

The colors can be customized in two ways. The first and simplest is to provide an
array of colors and the alternative is via the `TabColorizer` interface which gives
complete control over which color is used for any individual position.

The views used as tabs can be customized by calling `setCustomTabView(int, int)` providing the
layout ID of the custom layout.
