Android ElevationBasic Sample
===================================

This sample demonstrates ways to move a view in the z-axis using
`setTranslationZ()`. This method was introduced in API Level 21 ('Lollipop').

Introduction
------------

This sample uses two shapes, a circle and a square, and it demonstrates two
alternative ways to move a view in the z-axis. The first shape, the circle,
has a fixed elevation, which is defined in XML. The second view, the square,
changes its elevation using [setTranslationZ()][1] when a user touches it:

    shape2.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListener() {
        @Override
        public boolean onTouch(View view, MotionEvent motionEvent) {
            int action = motionEvent.getActionMasked();
            /* Raise view on ACTION_DOWN and lower it on ACTION_UP. */
            switch (action) {
                case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN:
                    Log.d(TAG, "ACTION_DOWN on view.");
                    view.setTranslationZ(120);
                    break;
                case MotionEvent.ACTION_UP:
                    Log.d(TAG, "ACTION_UP on view.");
                    view.setTranslationZ(0);
                    break;
                default:
                    return false;
            }
            return true;
        }
    });

The elevation reverts back once the touch is removed.
