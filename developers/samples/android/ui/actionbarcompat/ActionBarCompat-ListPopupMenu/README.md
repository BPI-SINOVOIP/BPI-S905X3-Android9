Android ActionBarCompat-ListPopupMenu Sample
===================================

This sample shows how to display a pop up menu using PopupMenu from the v7 appcompat library.

Introduction
------------

This sample displays a list of items and for each item, an icon can be clicked. When it is clicked, a pop up menu is shown, placed below the item, using the [PopupMenu][1] from the v7 appcompat support library.

The sample uses [ListFragment][2] from the v4 support library to display the list. It shows how to instantiate and display the [PopupMenu][1], as well as how to use `setOnMenuItemClickListener(new PopupMenu.OnMenuItemClickListener())` to process the user actions on the [PopupMenu][1].
