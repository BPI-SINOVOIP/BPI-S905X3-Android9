Android ActivitySceneTransitionBasic Sample
===================================

This sample shows how to use scene transitions from one Activity to another in Lollipop.
Uses a combination of changeImageTransform and changeBounds to transition a grid of images
to an Activity with a large image and detail text.

Introduction
------------

Android Lollipop has introduced the ability to transition between activities by using a shared element.
This sample demonstrates how to do this using the theme of your application.

See [Defining Custom Animations][1] for all the details on how to do this.
