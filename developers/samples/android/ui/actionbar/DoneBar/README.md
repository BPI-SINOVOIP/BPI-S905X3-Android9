Android DoneBar Sample
===================================

This sample shows how to create a custom view in the ActionBar to show a done button, using
2 alternative layouts. This is well suited for simple data entry activities, where the only
options for the user are to cancel or confirm the data changes.

Introduction
------------

API 11 introduced the [ActionBar][1] as a navigational UI element. In most cases, a custom view isn't required
or even recommended, as using a menu xml file is all that is needed to add action icons to it. However, it is
possible to use a custom view and it is useful in some cases.

This sample contains two activities with custom views in their action bar, each with a "done" button. These are
designed to be used with simple data entry screen where the only options for the user are to cancel or confirm
the changes.

1. Create a layout for the [ActionBar][2].
2. In the activity, before setting the content view, inflate the view using the LayoutInflater.
3. Use `getActionBar()` to get the ActionBar, and set the display options with `ActionBar.DISPLAY_SHOW_CUSTOM`.
4. Set the custom view by calling `setCustomView(customActionBarView, new ActionBar.LayoutParams(
ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT))` on the ActionBar.
5. You can now set the content view of the Activity.
