Android CustomChoiceList Sample
===================================

This sample demonstrates how to create custom checkable layouts, for use with ListView's choiceMode
attribute.

Introduction
------------

This sample demonstrates how to create custom single- or multi-choice [ListView][1] UIs on Android.

When a ListView has a `android:choiceMode` attribute set, it will allow users to "choose" one or more items. For
exmaple, refer to `res/layout/sample_main.xml` in this project:

```xml
<ListView android:id="@android:id/list"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="0dp"
    android:layout_weight="1"
    android:paddingLeft="@dimen/page_margin"
    android:paddingRight="@dimen/page_margin"
    android:scrollbarStyle="outsideOverlay"
    android:choiceMode="multipleChoice" />
```

The framework provides these default list item layouts that show standard radio buttons or check boxes next to a single
line of text:

- android.R.layout.simple_list_item_single_choice
- android.R.layout.simple_list_item_multiple_choice.

In some cases, you may want to customize this layout. When doing so, the root view must implement the Checkable
interface. For an example, see this sample's `CheckableLinearLayout` class.

Lastly, remember to use padding on your ListViews to adhere to the standard metrics described in the Android Design
guidelines. When doing so, you should set the `android:scrollbarStyle` attribute such that the scrollbar doesn't inset.
