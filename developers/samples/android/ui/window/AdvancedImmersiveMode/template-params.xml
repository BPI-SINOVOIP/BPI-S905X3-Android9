<![CDATA[
Android 4.4 (API Level 19) introduces a new `SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE`
flag for [setSystemUiVisibility()][1] that lets your app go truly "full
screen." This flag, when combined with the `SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION` and
`SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN` flags, hides the navigation and status bars
and lets your app capture all touch events on the screen.

When immersive full-screen mode is enabled, your activity continues
to receive all touch events. The user can reveal the system bars with
an inward swipe along the region where the system bars normally
appear.
