<!-- the versionCode is an integer representation of this version of your application.  New
     versions get higher numbers, so the upgrade system can avoid dealing with the ambiguity
     of "1.9" vs "1.10".  versionName, on the other hand, can be whatever you want, as the code
     that handles upgrading Android apps between versions on your device just ignores it.-->

             for creating a shortcut to in the Launcher.  If you wanted your app to have 5
             different Activities available in the launcher, you could just make 5 activities
