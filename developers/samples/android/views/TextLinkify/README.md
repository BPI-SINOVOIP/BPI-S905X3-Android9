Android TextLinkify Sample
===================================

This sample illustrates how links can be added to a TextView. This can be done either
automatically by setting the "autoLink" property or explicitly.

Introduction
------------

This sample demonstrates how clickable links can be added to a `TextView` in Android.

This can be done in three ways:

- **Automatically:** Text added to a TextView can automatically be linkified by enabling
autoLinking. In XML, use the `android:autoLink` property, programatically call
[android.widget.TextView#setAutoLinkMask(int)][1] using an option from
[android.text.util.Linkify][2].
- **Parsing a String as HTML:** See [android.text.Html#fromHtml(String)][3].
- **Manually by constructing a [android.text.SpannableString][4]:** Consisting of
[android.text.style.StyleSpan][5] and [android.text.style.URLSpan][6] objects that
are contained within a [android.text.SpannableString][7].
