Android ContentProviderPaging Sample
===================================

This sample demonstrates how to use the ContentProvider with paging support introduced
in Android O. The ContentProvider now accepts additional arguments for the offset and
the limit in the query method to support paging instead of fetching all the data in
a single query method call.

Introduction
------------

[ContentProvider][1] and [DocumentsProvider][2] now supports paging instead of fetching the all
data at once.

Starting from Android O, ContentProvider#query(Uri, String[], Bundle, CancellationSignal) and
DocumentsProvider#query(Uri, String[], Bundle, CancellationSignal) methods are introduced.
The Bundle accepts the keys for ContentResolver.QUERY_ARG_OFFSET as an starting offset and
ContentResolver.QUERY_ARG_LIMIT as the number of items included in the returned Cursor object.

Similarly, the returned Cursor object now has a Bundle object obtained by Cursor#getExtras().
The Bundle is able to include data such as the  total size of the underlying data set.
