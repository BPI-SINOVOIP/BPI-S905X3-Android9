x11font by Gerd Knorr
---------------------

Transcodes the libzvbi internal fonts into X11 fonts:
teletext.bdf	teletexti.bdf
caption.bdf	captioni.bdf

You can install like this (replace /usr/lib/X11/fonts by the name
of your fonts directory):

for f in *.bdf; do bdftopcf $f | \
  gzip >`echo /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/$f | sed s/bdf/pcf.gz/g`; done
mkfontdir /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc

# Now you may need to run:
xset fp rehash
/etc/rc.d/xfs restart

# Check if installation succeeded:
xlsfonts | grep -ets-

After you installed you can for example start an
xterm with "xterm -u8 -font <font>" and see the output
of test/unicode printed in libzvbi fonts.

ntsc-cc by various authors
--------------------------

This is a copy of the ntsc-cc tool from the Xawtv package using
libzvbi for driver access and bit slicing. Can be used to record
and display Closed Caption and eXtended Data Service data.

atsc-cc by Michael Schimek et al
--------------------------------

This is an ATSC (digital TV) version of ntsc-cc. Unlike ntsc-cc
this program also tunes in a station, and it can capture data from
all stations sharing a transponder frequency at one. The Closed
Caption decoder has been greatly improved (this code will be
integrated into the library and ntsc-cc after more tests) and a
basic DTVCC (CEA 708-C) decoder has been added.
