.IP "\fB\-T\fP"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-ts\fP"

still needs a station name to determine the Program ID of the video
elementary stream it should extract.
.SS "Tuning options"
.IP "\fB\-e\fP file name"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-channel\-conf\fP file name"
.PD
To tune in a TV station
.B zvbi-ntsc-cc
needs a channel configuration file. We use the config file of the
.B azap
tuning tool from the linuxtv\-dvb\-apps package. You can create
it with the
.B scan
tool from the same package.
.IP
This option selects a different channel configuration file.
The default is
.nf
.I $HOME/.azap/channels.conf
.fi
.IP "\fB\-L\fP \fB\-\-list\fP"
List all stations in the channel configuration file and their
transponder frequency.
.IP "\fB\-n\fP station name"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-station\fP station name"
.PD
The station to tune in. Usually the \fB\-n\fP can be omitted.
.IP
.B zvbi-ntsc-cc
can record caption from multiple stations at once if they share a
transponder frequency. Just specify multiple station names on
the command line to enable this.
.SS "Caption options"
With the caption and XDS options you must specify for each
station which data
.B zvbi-ntsc-cc
should extract. If multiple station names are given these
options apply to the next station on the command line.
.IP "\fB\-c\fP \fB\-\-cc\fP"
Print any received caption on standard output.
.IP "\fB\-C\fP file name"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-cc\-file\fP file name"
.PD

.IP "\fB\-\-cc1\-file\fP ... \fB\-\-cc4\-file\fP file name"
.PD
Filter out NTSC Closed Caption channel CC1 ... CC4 and append the text

service. If both services are transmitted CC1 usually carries English,
CC3 Spanish caption.
.IP "\fB\-5\fP ... \fB\-8\fP file name"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-t1\-file\fP ... \fB\-\-t4\-file\fP file name"

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-s1\-file\fP ... \fB\-\-s2\-file\fP file name"
.PD
Filter out DTVCC service 1 or 2 and append the text to the specified
file. Service 1 is the primary, service 2 the secondary caption
service. If both services are transmitted service 1 usually carries
English, service 2 Spanish caption.
.IP
Digital TV stations are supposed to transmit language codes and other
information about the available caption services but these are not
presently evaluated.
.B zvbi\-atsc\-cc
filters out text which does not appear to be caption, such as tickers
or vertically printed text.
.IP "\fB\-b\fP \fB\-\-no-webtv\fP"

.IP "\fB\-\-format\fP type"
.PD
When type is "plain"
.B zvbi\-atsc\-cc
prints caption and XDS text without any markup. When type is "vt100"
it faithfully reproduces the caption foreground and background
color, italic and underline attributes by inserting VT.100 terminal
control codes. With type "ntsc-cc" it mimics the output of the
.B ntsc-cc
and
.B zvbi-ntsc-cc
tool, which is also the default.
.IP
.B zvbi\-atsc\-cc supports all Closed Caption character sets and
converts to the encoding of the current locale, usually UTF-8.
.IP "\fB\-p\fP \fB\-\-plain\fP"
Same as \fB\-j\ plain\fP
