libzvbi 0.2.33, 2008-09-03
--------------------------
Fixes two zvbi-atsc-cc compile problems.

libzvbi 0.2.32, 2008-08-20
--------------------------
This version adds a new tool named zvbi-atsc-cc to record Closed
Caption from ATSC digital TV. It supports legacy NTSC caption
(EIA 608-B) and DTVCC (CEA 708-C).

libzvbi 0.2.31, 2008-07-26
--------------------------
The vbi_caption_unicode() function did not correctly translate
the small letter i with diaresis.

The files daemon/chains.c, daemon/proxyd.c,
test/proxy-test.c and test/cc-test-stream.dtd are now licensed
under GPLv2 or later as stated in the top README file.

libzvbi 0.2.30, 2008-03-05
--------------------------
This is a bugfix release restoring the functions vbi_unref_page(),
vbi_is_cached() and vbi_cache_hi_subno() which were accidentally
dropped in libzvbi 0.2.28.

libzvbi 0.2.29, 2008-02-24
--------------------------
This version fixes incompatibilities with strict ISO C in the
libzvbi header file.

libzvbi 0.2.28, 2008-02-22
--------------------------
The ZVBI libraries libzvbi and libzvbi-chains are now licensed under
the terms of the GNU Library General Public License version 2 or
later. Example programs are now licensed under a 2-clause BSD-style
license. The VBI proxy daemon, contributed programs, test programs
and programs required to build the library remain licensed under
GNU General Public License version 2 or later.

Bug fixes:
- A Teletext Level 2.5 transparency attribute bug was fixed in
  the teletext decoder.
- The capture test tool did not work with DVB devices.

Other changes:
- The VTX export module has been disabled for licensing reasons. It
  may return after a rewrite.
- New BCD functions and vbi_ham24p(), counterpart of vbi_unham24p(),
  were added.
- The artificial 41st column in Teletext pages is no longer black
  but continues the previous column if appropriate.
- The --default-cs option of the export test tool now works with
  libzvbi 0.2 as well.

libzvbi 0.2.27, 2008-02-14
--------------------------
This is a bugfix release.

- The DVB VBI demultiplexer entered an endless loop on some input.
- The Closed Caption special character conversion did not work.

libzvbi 0.2.26, 2007-11-27
--------------------------
- The experimental DVB VBI multiplexer was improved and support for
  raw VBI data was added. It is now part of the API.
- The bit slicer was improved to give better results with noisy
  Closed Caption signals and the capture device simulator can now
  simulate noisy signals. Thanks go to Rich Kadel for testing.
- Tom Zoerner contributed an XPM export module and added support for
  an 8-bit indexed format to the Teletext page rendering functions.
  The PNG and PPM modules work a little more efficiently now. Two
  functions were added to export Teletext and Closed Caption pages
  into memory instead of an i/o stream or file.

Bug fixes:
- The V4L2 capture interface did not properly initialize the
  parameters for VIDIOC_QBUF and VIDIOC_DQBUF ioctl calls. It also
  failed to resume capturing after the bttv driver returned an EIO
  error.
- The DVB capture interface did not work with all drivers because
  the device file was opened for reading and writing.
- The vbi_sliced_name() and vbi_sliced_payload_bits() functions
  returned nothing for VBI_SLICED_TELETEXT_B_L25_625.
- The Teletext decoder permitted double width characters in the
  last column.
- In the vbi_pfc_demux_cb function prototype the second and third
  parameter were swapped. Fix by Tom Zoerner.
- The vbi_decoder_delete function did not free the event handler list.
- The text and HTML export modules did not free some internal data on
  errors.

The test tools were improved:
- All tools now support a --verbose option for debugging, and --quiet,
  --help, --usage and --version options.
- The capture tool can now generate DVB VBI PES and TS streams with
  variable packet size to reduce the number of stuffing bytes, and
  user defined TS PID. An -o output file option was added. New device
  simulation options were added and raw VBI capturing is now possible.
  Capturing through the VBI proxy was added by Tom Zoerner. The
  timestamps in the output were incorrect if a frame contained no
  data, this was fixed.
- The decode tool now accepts DVB VBI PES and TS streams and an -i
  input file option was added. IDL-A decoding works again.
- The export tool now accepts DVB VBI PES and TS streams and an -i
  input file option was added. It can now export multiple pages, has
  a new -o output file option, and can list the possible file formats
  and conversion options.
- The sliced2pes tool now also accepts DVB VBI PES and TS streams, has
  a new -i input and -o output file option, and can produce DVB VBI
  PES and TS streams with user defined packet size, data_identifier
  and TS PID.
- The ttxfilter tool accepts DVB VBI PES and TS streams, has a new -i
  input and -o output file option. A time option was added to cut
  Teletext (esp. subtitle) streams. Various bugs were fixed.
- Courtesy of Tom the osc tool can now capture raw data through the
  VBI proxy.
- Raw VBI capturing with the proxy-test tool works again, also fixed
  by Tom.

Build fixes:
- The package did not compile with ./configure --disable-static
  (bug #1692015).

libzvbi 0.2.25, 2007-03-09
--------------------------
This version fixes a buffer overflow bug in the zvbi-ntsc-cc
tool which may cause a segfault on reception errors. Secondly it
fixes a GNU/kFreeBSD compile problem (Debian bug #407621).

libzvbi 0.2.24, 2006-11-29
--------------------------
This version fixes a bug in the zvbi-ntsc-cc tool which may cause
a segfault on reception errors.

libzvbi 0.2.23, 2006-10-27
--------------------------
This versions adds a few helper functions to convert Closed Caption
and UCS-2 strings. The raw VBI decoder was modified to handle a CC
signal with incorrect clock run-in.

The zvbi-ntsc-cc tool can now decode all caption channels
simultaneously and convert from caption to locale character encoding
for proper display of Spanish captions. It can write caption and XDS
information to separate files. Some bugs in the XDS decoder were fixed
and a filter was added to discard unwanted XDS information and WebTV
links.

Fixes:
- The library did not compile on GNU/kFreeBSD due to a name space
  conflict with the RAW macro (Debian bug #372302).

libzvbi 0.2.22, 2006-05-30
--------------------------
This version adds a simulated raw and sliced VBI capture device
to debug applications. The VBI simulation in the capture and osc
tools is more accurate and VPS signals can be simulated. Functions to
convert sliced VBI data to raw VBI images are public now and an example
application was added. An interface to enable warning and debugging
messages was added.

Fixes:
- Bit slicing of WSS data started a little early. It should work
  better now with noisy signals.
- The WSS capture example used an incorrect bytes-per-line value.
- A work-around for a line allocation bug in older versions of
  the bttv driver was added. Enables capturing of single lines
  (VPS, WSS, CC).

libzvbi 0.2.21, 2006-05-10
--------------------------
This is a bugfix release.

- Capturing WSS data from video images failed due to a broken check
  in the raw VBI decoder.

libzvbi 0.2.20, 2006-05-08
--------------------------
This version supports raw VBI capturing with unknown field order, adds
a work-around for a VBI offset bug in the bttv driver, enables
additional debugging messages and improves some test tools. Network
identification now returns CNIs and a network identification example
was added. The CNI (networks) table was updated.

libzvbi 0.2.19, 2006-02-23
--------------------------
This is a bugfix release.

- Due to a preprocessor mishap zvbi-ntsc-cc did not use libzvbi but
  its own VBI decoder.

libzvbi 0.2.18, 2006-02-11
--------------------------
This is a bugfix release.

- The configure script has been modernized. Building from CVS now requires
  automake 1.9, autoconf 2.59 and gettext 0.14.
- Diego Petten√≤ added a configure option to disable documentation
  building regardless if doxygen is installed.
- After make clean src/Makefile tried to rebuild network-table.h from
  http://zapping.sourceforge.net/zvbi-0.3/networks.xml and other
  source files. This make rule was only intended for the maintainer.
- A pointer aliasing bug in the linked list implementation of the
  Teletext cache, which may crash applications, has been fixed.
- In previous versions GCC may not have inlined some bit slicer and
  page rendering functions, making them much slower.
- The teletext filter added in 0.2.17 did not work with parallel page
  transmission (e.g. BBC).
- The code was cleaned up to muffle compiler warnings (Diego).

libzvbi 0.2.17, 2005-10-07
--------------------------
This version adds missing XDS packet subclasses to the XDS
demultiplexer. The contrib directory now contains a version of the
ntsc-cc Closed Caption decoder from the Xawtv package using libzvbi
for driver access and bit slicing. It installs as zvbi-ntsc-cc. The
CNI (networks) table was updated. The test tools were cleaned up
and a teletext filter was added.

Fixes:
- The DVB multiplexer didn't work right (used by test tools only,
  not part of the API yet).
- The ioctl logger (test stuff) didn't log VIDIOC_G_STD
  and VIDIOC_S_STD.
- test/decode option -a didn't work.

libzvbi 0.2.16, 2005-05-25
--------------------------
This version adds a new demultiplexer to extract XDS data from a
caption stream (EIA 608).

Fixes:
- test/caption, test/osc did not compile due to a bug in the
  configure script.
- Removed a misplaced assertion in vbi_capture_io_update_timeout().
- test/osc, test/capture, test/wss -d option segfaulted.
- Fixed NTSC VBI capturing in the Linux saa7134 0.2.13 driver and
  added a partial work-around here for older versions.
- The HTML export module segfaulted. Fix by Bernhard Rosenkraenzer.

libzvbi 0.2.15, 2005-03-28
--------------------------
This is a bugfix release. Due to an incorrect bytes per line check
previous versions could not capture VBI data from the ivtv driver.

libzvbi 0.2.14, 2005-02-28
--------------------------
This version adds new demultiplexers to extract data transmissions
from Teletext streams, namely in "Page Format Clear" format (e.g.
NexTView EPG) and "Independent Data Line Format A". A new low-level
decoding tool was added for tests.

libzvbi 0.2.13, 2005-01-23
--------------------------
This version has new, more reliable DVB VBI capture routines.  See
the documentation of vbi_capture_dvb_new() for details.

Fixes:
- vbi_capture_bktr_new() ignored the scanning parameter, always
  assuming 625 line systems (e.g. PAL-BGHI, SECAM-L).
- Include fix in test/wss.c.
- vbi_unham8() return type signedness fix.
- GCC 4.0 compile fixes.

libzvbi 0.2.12, 2005-01-18
--------------------------
Various error correction functions, generator and bit reversal
functions useful for VBI decoding are public now.  A new test app
has been added to capture WSS data from video images. French
translation update by Christian Marillat.

Bttv drivers 0.9.0 - 0.9.15 report wrong PAL/SECAM field 2 line numbers.
A work-around has been added, and a bug compatible Teletext data
service table entry has been corrected.

If you encounter problems using similarly broken drivers please try a
fuzzy match of driver capabilities and data service parameters (e.g.
vbi_capture_v4l2_new(strict <= 1)) and notify mschimek@users.sf.net.

The test/capture and test/osc apps did not capture PAL/SECAM line 23
(WSS), this has been fixed.

libzvbi 0.2.11, 2004-12-31
--------------------------
Build fix. Cough.

libzvbi 0.2.10, 2004-12-30
--------------------------
The bit slicer and raw VBI decoder have been replaced by improved and
better tested versions. Developers please note: memory will leak if
you do not call vbi_raw_decoder_destroy().

The raw decoder now supports Teletext system A, C and D and pseudo-VPS
on the second field. Blank line detection has been disabled. As a result
the decoder will run a bit slower but Robin Imrie pointed out that
caption / subtitles may be lost if the signal inserter is disabled
during longer periods of silence.

The DVB demultiplexer added in 0.2.9 is now public.

Other fixes:
- In 0.2.9 the I/O routines may crash if passed a NULL errorstr pointer.
- Replaced uname call in configure.in by AC_CANONICAL_HOST.
- Missing documentation.

0.2.9
-----
This version contains the VBI proxy code by Tom Zoerner. With the proxy
multiple applications can share a V4L or V4L2 VBI device. For details see
daemon/README.

Distro packagers please consider adding the proxy daemon to the system
init sequence.

Other changes:
- Libzvbi now installs a zvbi-0.2.pc (pkg-config) file.
- Added ioctl logging to V4L and V4L2 interface for tests.
- Extended capture and osc apps for easier i/o testing.
- Added experimental DVB mux & demux. Not yet supported by the
  DVB driver interface due to lack of testing but test/capture
  and test/export use it.

Fixes:
- Teletext decoder: switching between primary and secondary character
  set did not work right.

0.2.8
-----
Updated the network identification table from TR 101 231 EBU (2004-04a).
Incorporated corrections by Stephane Loeuillet (bug #942434).

0.2.7
-----
Fixes a bug in the v4l2 interface, didn't work with bttv driver 0.9.12.

0.2.6
-----
Libzvbi goes digital! Gerd Knorr contributed a Linux DVB interface.
It's not really finished yet but seems usable. You can try this:
test/capture --device /dev/dvb/adapter<n>/demux<n> --pid 123 --dump-ttx
Further James Mastros improved test/osc and a segv bug was fixed
in the page formatting code.

0.2.5
-----
New this time is a vbi_version() function to query the version
of the library at runtime. If your application uses autoconf to
configure you can test for its presence with the AC_CHECK_LIB
macro. The remaining changes are bug fixes, read about the
details in ChangeLog.

0.2.4
-----
V4L2 (Linux 2.5+) devices were not correctly identified because
the API changed since the interface was first added in version
0.2.3. This version contains an updated header file.

0.2.3
-----
Bug fixes, mostly compile problems. This version supports the
refurbished V4L2 API for Linux 2.5ff and has been ported to
FreeBSD 4.6, including a bktr driver interface. Basic tests ok,
remains to be seen how well this works in the field.

0.2.2
-----
RH 7.3 build fix (zapping-Bugs-568052) and switch to gettext 0.11.
Libzvbi can now build in a separate dir. Several other bug fixes,
most notably localization works now.

0.2.1
-----
Bug fixes.

0.2
---
Bug fixes, most notably the character code range check in the
Closed Caption decoder, a V4L2 interface update to work with bttv
0.8.x, and new handler registration functions (the old ones were
retained for compatibility).

0.1.1
-----
Bug fixes.

0.1
---
Former module of the Zapping TV viewer, this is the first release
of the Zapping/Zapzilla VBI decoder as a standalone library.
