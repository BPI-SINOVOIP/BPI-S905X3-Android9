  Introduction
  ============

  The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in an analog
  television signal that temporarily suspends transmission of the
  signal for the electron gun to move back up to the first line of the
  television screen to trace the next screen field. The vertical
  blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything sent
  during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test
  signals, closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent
  during this time period.

  The ZVBI library provides functions to read from Linux V4L, V4L2 and
  FreeBSD BKTR raw VBI capture devices, from Linux DVB devices and
  from a VBI proxy to share V4L and V4L2 VBI devices between multiple
  applications.

  It can demodulate raw to sliced VBI data in software, with support
  for a wide range of formats, has functions to decode several popular
  services including Teletext and Closed Caption, a Teletext cache
  with search function, various text export and rendering functions.

  Basically ZVBI offers all functions needed by VBI applications
  except for the user interface. The library was written for the
  Zapping TV viewer http://zapping.sourceforge.net.

  For details on using the library see the documentation in doc/html
  (built only if you have Doxygen http://www.doxygen.org/ installed)
  and the files in the test and examples directories.


  Bindings
  ========

  Tom Zoerner wrote a Perl interface to libzvbi. The ZVBI Perl module
  covers all exported libzvbi functions. Most of the functions and
  parameters are exposed nearly identical, or with minor adaptions for
  the Perl idiom.
