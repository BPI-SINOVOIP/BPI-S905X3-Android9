*
* Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
*     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
* Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
* of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
*
*			    Preamble
*
*  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
*freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
*License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
*software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
*General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
*Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
*using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
*the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
*your programs, too.
*
*  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
*price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
*have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
*this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
*if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
*in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
*
*  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
*anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
*These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
*distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
*
*  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
*gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
*you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
*source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
*rights.
*
*  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
*(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
*distribute and/or modify the software.
*
*  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
*that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
*software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
*want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
*that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
*authors' reputations.
*
*  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
*patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
*program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
*program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
*patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
*
*  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
*modification follow.
*
*		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
*   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
*
*  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
*a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
*under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
*refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
*means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
*that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
*either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
*language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
*the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
*
*Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
*covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
*running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
*is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
*Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
*Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
*
*  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
*source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
*conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
*copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
*notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
*and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
*along with the Program.
*
*You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
*you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
*
*  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
*of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
*distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
*above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
*
*    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
*    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
*
*    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
*    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
*    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
*    parties under the terms of this License.
*
*    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
*    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
*    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
*    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
*    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
*    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
*    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
*    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
*    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
*    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
*
*These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
*identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
*and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
*themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
*sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
*distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
*on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
*this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
*entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
*
*Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
*your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
*exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
*collective works based on the Program.
*
*In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
*with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
*a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
*the scope of this License.
*
*  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
*under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
*Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
*
*    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
*    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
*    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
*
*    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
*    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
*    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
*    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
*    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
*    customarily used for software interchange; or,
*
*    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
*    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
*    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
*    received the program in object code or executable form with such
*    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

*The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
*making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
*code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
*associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
*control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
*special exception, the source code distributed need not include
*anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
*form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
*operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
*itself accompanies the executable.
*
*If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
*access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
*access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
*distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
*compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
*
*  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
*except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
*otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
*void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
*However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
*this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
*parties remain in full compliance.
*
*  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
*signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
*distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
*prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
*modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
*Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
*all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
*the Program or works based on it.
*
*  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
*Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
*original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
*these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
*restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
*You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
*this License.
*
*  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
*infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
*conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
*otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
*excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
*distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
*License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
*may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
*license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
*all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
*the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
*refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
*
*If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
*any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
*apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
*circumstances.
*
*It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
*patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
*such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
*integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
*implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
*generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
*through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
*system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
*to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
*impose that choice.
*
*This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
*be a consequence of the rest of this License.
*
*  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
*certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
*original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
*may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
*those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
*countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
*the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
*
*  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
*of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
*be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
*address new problems or concerns.
*
*Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
*specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
*later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
*either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
*Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
*this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
*Foundation.
*
*  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
*programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
*to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
*Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
*make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
*of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
*of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
*
*			    NO WARRANTY
*
*  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
*FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
*OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
*PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
*OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
*MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
*TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
*PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
*REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
*
*  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
*WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
*REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
*INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
*OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
*TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
*YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
*PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
*POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
*
*		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
*
*	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
*
*  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
*possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
*free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
*
*  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
*to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
*convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
*the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
*
*    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
*    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
*
*    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
*    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
*    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
*    (at your option) any later version.
*
*    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
*    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
*    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
*    GNU General Public License for more details.
*
*    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
*    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
*    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
*
*
*Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
*
*If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
*when it starts in an interactive mode:
*
*    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
*    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
*    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
*    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
*
*The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
*parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
*be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
*mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
*
*You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
*school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
*necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
*
*  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
*  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
*
*  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
*  Ty Coon, President of Vice
*
*This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
*proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
*consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
*library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
*Public License instead of this License.
