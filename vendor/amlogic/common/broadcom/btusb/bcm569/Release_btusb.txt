To compile the Bluetooth USB Driver (BTUSB) you have to:
> cd /3rdparty/embedded/brcm/linux/btusb
> make

The Makefile may need to be adapted to the target:
KDIR := /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build    => For local kernel (currently running)
KDIR := /opt/brcm/linux                         => For different kernel, it should point to the appropriate kernel version

By default btusb supports the most Broadcom's BT controller types.
To restrict the support to a single VID/PID (USB identifier of the BT controller type), the BTUSB_VID and BTUSB_PID can be defined.
For 20702 the values to use are:
EXTRA_CFLAGS += -DBTUSB_VID=0x0A5C
EXTRA_CFLAGS += -DBTUSB_PID=0x22BE

To install the btusb.ko module, you may have to create a node in /dev:
mknod btusb0 c 180 194

Furthermore, BlueZ must be uninstalled to avoid driver conflicts.

See BSA Software user guide for further information.

BTUSB Compile Options for Lite Stack Support:
> make LITE=FALSE         => No StackLite (Default)"
> make LITE=TRUE          => StackLite compiled"
> make SEC=FALSE          => No SEC Encoder Support(default)"
> make SEC=TRUE           => SEC Encoder Support (Requires StackLite)
