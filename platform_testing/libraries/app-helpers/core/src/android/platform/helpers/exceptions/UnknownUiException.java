/**
 * An UnknownUiException is an exception specific to UI-driven app helpers. This should be thrown
 * when specific UI conditions, generally post-conditions, are not met for some unknown reason.
 * <p>
 * Examples include (but are not limited to): opening an e-mail and not finding any open message,
 * loading a website and not seeing any content, being on GCA in camera mode without a flash button.
 * <p>
 * These exceptions are likely a manifestation of unhandled conditions or UI updates, but cannot
 * explicitly say so without further diagnosis.
