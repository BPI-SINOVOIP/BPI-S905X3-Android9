# Rules to generate setup script for device perf tests
# Different devices may share the same script. To add a new script, define a
# new variable named <device name>_script, pointing at the script in current
# source folder.
# At execution time, scripts will be pushed onto device and run with root
# identity

LOCAL_PATH:= $(call my-dir)

# only define the target if a perf setup script is defined by the BoardConfig
# of the device we are building.
#
# To add a new script:
# 1. add a new setup script suitable for the device at:
#    platform_testing/scripts/perf-setup/
# 2. modify BoardConfig.mk of the corresponding device under:
#    device/<OEM name>/<device name/
# 3. add variable "BOARD_PERFSETUP_SCRIPT", and point it at the path to the new
#    perf setup script; the path should be relative to the build root
ifneq ($(strip $(BOARD_PERFSETUP_SCRIPT)),)
