The object in this prebuilt directory is a copy of the jar from
    platform/prebuilts/devtools/tools/lib/

From the commit d7638b6496f75e896badacddb40a9dd018553bfc

Note: Before dropping the devtools-annotations-prebuilt.jar, please
run the following command to strip the jar manifest file,
which causes hidden dependency on jars in the Class-Path.
$ zip -d devtools-annotations-prebuilt.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
