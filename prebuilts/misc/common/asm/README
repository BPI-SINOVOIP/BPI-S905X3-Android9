We have 2 versions of the ASM library in our source tree:

The one in prebuilt/common/asm is used for build-time utilities. It
has a module name in the form of "asm-5.2".

The one in prebuilts/tools/common/asm-tools is shipped in the
SDK/tools/lib/ folder. It has modules names in the form of "asm-tools"
and "asm-tree-tools" for example.

These are maintained separately because the prebuilt/ version is
branched with the platform, and the prebuilts/tools/ version is
branched with the tools, and these have different release schedules
and branches.
