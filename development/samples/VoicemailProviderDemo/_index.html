This is a simple sample application that demonstrates how to use voicemail
content provider APIs to insert new voicemail records.
</p>
<p>
The application includes
 <a href="src/com/example/android/voicemail/AddVoicemailActivity.html">
    <code>AddVoicemailActivity</code>
 </a>,
an activity that lets the user enter voicemail details and record voicemail audio,
which can then be stored with the voicemail content provider by tapping the "Send"
button.

In the real world, a similar application could download voicemails from a
remote voicemail server and store them locally with the voicemail content
provider. The platform would then take care of notification and rendering of the
voicemails.

Following interfaces are of particular interest:
<ul>
   <li>
     <a href="src/com/example/android/voicemail/common/core/VoicemailProviderHelper.html">
      <code>VoicemailProviderHelper</code>
     </a> and its implementation in
     <a href="src/com/example/android/voicemail/common/core/VoicemailProviderHelpers.html">
      <code>VoicemailProviderHelpers</code>
     </a>.
     This interface provides a good demonstration of various fields exposed by voicemail
     content provider and their usage.
   </li>
   <li>
     <a href="src/com/example/android/voicemail/common/core/Voicemail.html">
       <code>Voicemail</code>
     </a> and its implementation in
    <a href="src/com/example/android/voicemail/common/core/VoicemailImpl.html">
      <code>VoicemailImpl</code> </a>.
      This interface provides a structured view of most the important fields in
      voicemail content provider.
   </li>
 </ul>
