<p>This sample shows how to use the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/effect/package-summary.html">Media
Effects APIs</a> that were introduced in Android 4.0. These APIs let you apply
effects to image frames represented as OpenGL ES 2.0 textures. Image frames can
be images loaded from disk, frames from the device's camera, or other video
streams.</p>
