<p>A simple music player that illustrates how to make a multimedia application
that manages media playback from a service. It allows the user to play music
available on the device or specify a URL from which the media should be
streamed.  It also illustrates how to use the notification system to indicate
an ongoing task and how to deal with audio focus changes.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Update:</strong> This sample also illustrates how to use the
<code><a href="../../../reference/android/media/RemoteControlClient.html">RemoteControlClient</a></code>
class added in API level 14 to integrate with music playback remote controls
such as those found on the lockscreen.</p>
