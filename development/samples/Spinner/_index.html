<p>
This sample is a simple application that serves as an application under test
for the <a href="../SpinnerTest/index.html">SpinnerTest</a> test application example.
</p>
<p>
This application illustrates basic state management across the Android application life cycle,
mainly for the purpose of highlighting common patterns of Activity testing. When the application
is first run, the spinner widget displays a default selection of &quot;Earth&quot;.
Thereafter, the application saves a selection as soon as it
is made. The application remembers the selection from invocation to invocation, even
if the device reboots.
</p>
<p>
The test application <a href="../SpinnerTest/index.html">SpinnerTest</a>
shows you how to set up tests to monitor and prevent code regressions in the
management of state across invocations and power cycles.
