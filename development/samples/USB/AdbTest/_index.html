<p>AdbTest is a sample program that implements a subset of the <code>adb</code> USB protocol.
Currently it only implements the <code>adb logcat</code> command and displays the log
output in a text view and only allows connecting to one device at a time.
However, the support classes are structured in a way that would allow
connecting to multiple devices and running multiple <code>adb</code> commands simultaneously.</p>

<p>This program serves as an example of the following USB host features:</p>

<ul> 
<li>Matching devices based on interface class, subclass and protocol (see <code>device_filter.xml</code>)</li>

<li>Asynchronous IO on bulk endpoints</li>
</ul>
