<p>This is a sample Home application. The Home application that users use
to launch applications by default is an ordinary application itself.
A user can install additional Home applications and pick which one to use as the
default Home. This is a sample of such an alternative.</p>

<p>This is actually the source of an old incarnation of the default Home application,
which may look familiar if you played with some of the older pre-1.0 SDKs.</p>
