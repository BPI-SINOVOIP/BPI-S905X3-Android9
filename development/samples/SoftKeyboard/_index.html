<p>This application is an example of writing an input method for a software keyboard.  
This code is focused on simplicity over completeness, so it should in no way be considered
to be a complete soft keyboard implementation.  Its purpose is to provide
a basic example for how you would get started writing an input method, to
be fleshed out as appropriate.</p>
