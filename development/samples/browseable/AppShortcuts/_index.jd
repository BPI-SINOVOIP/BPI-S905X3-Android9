<p>
            
            This sample demonstrates how to use the Launcher Shortcuts API introduced in API 25.
            This API allows an application to define a set of Intents which are displayed as
            when a user long-presses on the app's launcher icon. Examples are given for
            registering both links both statically in XML, as well as dynamically at runtime.
