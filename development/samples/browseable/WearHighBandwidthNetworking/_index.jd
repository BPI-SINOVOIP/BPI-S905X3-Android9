Sample demonstrates how to determine if a high-bandwidth network is available for use cases that
require a minimum network bandwidth, such as streaming media or downloading large files. In
addition, the sample demonstrates best practices for asking a user to add a new Wi-Fi network for
high-bandwidth network operations if the bandwidth of currently available networks is inadequate.
