This sample demonstrates how to create watch faces for android wear and includes a phone app
and a wearable app. The wearable app has a variety of watch faces including analog, digital,
opengl, calendar, steps, interactive, etc. It also includes a watch-side configuration example.
The phone app includes a phone-side configuration example.

Because watch face apps do not have a default Activity in their project, you will need to set your
Configurations to "Do not launch Activity" for both the Wear and Application modules. If you are
unsure how to do this, please review the "Run Starter project" section in the
[Google Watch Face Code Lab][1].

For the Fit Distance related watch face, authentication IS a requirement to request distance from
Google Fit on Wear. Otherwise, distance will always come back as zero (or stay at whatever the
distance was prior to you de-authorizing the watch face).

To authenticate and communicate with Google Fit, you must create a project in the Google Developers
Console, activate the Fitness API, create an OAuth 2.0 client ID, and register the public
certificate from your signed APK. More details can be found [here][2].

If the user has not installed or setup the Google Fit app on their phone and their Wear device has
not configured the Google Fit Wear App, then you may get zero steps until one of the two is setup.
Please note, many Wear devices configure the Google Fit Wear App beforehand.
