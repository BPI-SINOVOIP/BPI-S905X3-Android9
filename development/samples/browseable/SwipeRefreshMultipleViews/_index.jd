            A sample which shows how to use SwipeRefreshLayout to add the \'swipe-to-refresh\'
            gesture to a layout with multiple children, enabling the ability to trigger a
            refresh from swiping down on the visible view. In this sample, SwipeRefreshLayout
            contains a scrollable GridView, along with a TextView empty view.
