<p>

This sample aims to be as close to a real world example of a mobile
and Wear app combination as possible. It has a more refined design
and also provides a practical example of how a mobile app would
interact and communicate with its wear counterpart.

The app itself is modeled after a hypothetical tourist attractions
app that notifies the user when they are in close proximity to
notable points of interest.

The Wear component loads a full wearable app that shows images,
summary information and provides quick actions for nearby tourist
attractions in a GridViewPager UI component.
