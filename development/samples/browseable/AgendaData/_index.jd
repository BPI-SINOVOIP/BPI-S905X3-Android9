            Syncs calendar events to your wearable at the press of a button, using the Wearable
            DataApi to transmit data such as event time, description, and background image. The
            DataItems can be deleted individually via an action on the event notifications, or all
            at once via a button on the companion. When deleted using the notification action, a
            ConfirmationActivity is used to indicate success or failure.
