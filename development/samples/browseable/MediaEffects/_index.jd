<p>
            
            This sample shows how to use the Media Effects APIs that were introduced in Android 4.0.
            These APIs let you apply effects to image frames represented as OpenGL ES 2.0 textures.
            Image frames can be images loaded from disk, frames from the device\'s camera, or other
            video streams.
