            A sample which shows how to use SwipeRefreshLayout within a ListFragment to add the
            \'swipe-to-refresh\' gesture to a ListView, enabling the ability to trigger a refresh
            from swiping down on that view. This is provided through the re-usable
            SwipeRefreshListFragment class.
