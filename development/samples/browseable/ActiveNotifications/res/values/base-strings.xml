Notifications can now be grouped in Android N. Since Android M, the
NotificationManager can tell you how many notifications your application
is currently showing. This sample demonstrates how to use these APIs
together for a nicer user experience when an app may have multiple
notifications. To get started, press the "add a notification" button.
If you add more than one notification a notification summary will be
added. When a notification is being canceled, the count gets updated
via a PendingIntent.
