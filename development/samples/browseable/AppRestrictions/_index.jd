            This sample demonstrates the use of the App Restriction feature, which is available on
            Android 4.3 and above tablet device with the multiuser feature.

            When launched under the primary User account, you can toggle between standard app restriction
            types and custom.  When launched under a restricted profile, this activity displays app
            restriction settings, if available.
