<p>
            
            When a user enters the vicinity of the Android building (B44) or the Yerba Buena
            Gardens near the Moscone center in San Francisco, a notification silently appears on his/her
            wearable with an option to check in. This notification automatically disappears when he/she leaves
            the area, and reappears the next time he/she is at one of these locations.
