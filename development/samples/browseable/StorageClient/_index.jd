            Using the OPEN_DOCUMENT intent, a client app can access a list of Document Providers
            on the device, and choose a file from any of them.
            \n\nTo demonstrate this, click the button below to open up the Storage Access Framework
            interface, and choose an image on your device.  It will be displayed in this app.
