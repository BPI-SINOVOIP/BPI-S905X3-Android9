<p>
            
            \n\n\n\"Immersive Mode\", added in Android 4.4, improves the \"hide full screen\" and
            \"hide nav bar\" modes, by letting users swipe the bars in and out.  This sample
            lets the user experiment with immersive mode by seeing how it interacts
            with some of the other UI flags related to full-screen apps.
