            This sample is a mostly empty wearable app that implements a fullscreen activity
            conforming to Android Wear best practices. Included in the sample are examples of GridViewPager,
            DelayedConfirmationView, and DismissOverlayView. Developers who require a fullscreen activity for
            their wearable app can use this sample as a starting point.
