<p>JetBoy is a sample game that demonstrates the use of the 
<a href="../../../reference/android/media/JetPlayer.html">android.media.JetPlayer</a> 
class to implement an interactive music soundtrack in an application. JetBoy uses 
<a href="../../../guide/topics/media/index.html#jet">JET content created with
JetCreator</a> and game-generated events fed to JetPlayer 
to adapt the soundtrack to the user actions. Listen to how the melody picks 
up when you start shooting asteroids, how you are congratulated when you 
hit several asteroids in a row, or destroy enough of them in the allotted time.</p>

<p>The JetBoyView.java file in JetBoy illustrates the loading of JET content 
(loading a file, queuing segments), its playback, and how to alter what 
is currently playing (use of clips and mute masks).</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
The <code>JETBOY_content/</code> directory is empty in this online presentation of 
the application. For complete access to all the JetBoy files, see the sample code included
in the SDK, located at <code>&lt;sdk>/platforms/&lt;platform>/samples/JetBoy/</code>.
