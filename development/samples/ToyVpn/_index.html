<p>ToyVPN is a sample application that shows how to build a VPN client using the <a href="../../../reference/android/net/VpnService.html">VpnService</a> class introduced in API level 14.</p>

<p>This application consists of an Android client and a sample implementation of a server.  It performs IP over UDP and is capable of doing seamless handover between different networks as long as it receives the same VPN parameters.</p>

<p>The sample code of the server-side implementation is Linux-specific and is available in the <code>server</code> directory. To run the server or port it to another platform, please see comments in the code for the details.</p>
