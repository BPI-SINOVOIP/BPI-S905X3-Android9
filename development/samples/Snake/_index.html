<p>This is an implementation of the classic Game "Snake", in which you control a
serpent roaming around the garden looking for apples. Be careful, though,
because when you catch one, not only will you become longer, but you'll move
faster. Running into yourself or the walls will end the game..</p>

<p>This code demonstrates how to create custom View layouts and
request draws to the screen. A great example of a basic game that does not
require a fast framerate.</p>
