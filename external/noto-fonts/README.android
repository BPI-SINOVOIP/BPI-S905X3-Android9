This directory contains the fonts from the Noto project, chosen for
Android.

The fonts for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean have a different copyright
holder and upstream source, and are included in the 'cjk' subdirectory,
separate from the rest of the fonts.

The color emoji font also has a different upstream source, and is included
in the 'emoji' subdirectory.

The rest of the fonts are included in the 'other' subdirectory.

See README.android files in each subdirectory for details.
