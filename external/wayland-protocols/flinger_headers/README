These header files are extensions to inputflinger and surfaceflinger that are
only used by ARC++.  They are too light to create a separate project for them, so
put them under an isolated folder in external/wayland-protocols, because
wayland stuff in vendor/google_arc implement them, and
inputflinger/surfaceflinger can't depend on code under vendor/.
