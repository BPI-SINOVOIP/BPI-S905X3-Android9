********************
TPM2 CODE GENERATION
********************

Code generation scripts for libtpm2 process TCG TPM2 library specification in
HTML form and generate the appropriate type definitions and interface code.


====================
 TPM SPECIFICATION
====================

See http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org.  This version of libtpm2 is based on
Family TPM 2.0 Level 00 Revision 01.16.

Parts 2,3 and 4 of the specification were converted from PDF into HTML using
Adobe Acrobat editor, and tarred and zipped into TPM2_Parts_2_3_4.tgz.

Note that presently the scripts still do not process part4, and ignore all
source code included in part 3.

=========================================
      REGENERATING TPM2 SOURCE CODE
=========================================

Run this command in the root tpm2 directory:

$ generator/generator.py generator/TPM2_Parts_2_3_4.tgz

The generator can also be invoked with separate html files as command line
arguments:

$ generator/generator.py <part2>.html <part3>.html
