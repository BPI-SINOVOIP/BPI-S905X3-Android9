## WALT Android App Privacy Policy

This file is required in order to comply with Google Play requirements for apps using sensitive permissions:
https://play.google.com/about/privacy-security/additional-requirements/

WALT app processes all data locally on the Android device and does not transmit any information via the Internet,
unless you explicitly opt-in to upload test logs and results to our server in the app settings 
(when such functionality becomes available).

If you choose to opt-in to uploading the logs, please note that the logs can (and likely will) become publicly available to all.

WALT app needs the Internet permission on ChromeOS devices where USB is not available to Android apps 
and a TCP bridge is used instead.
