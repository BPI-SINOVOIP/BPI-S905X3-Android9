.SH DESCRIPTION

bno_plot is a visualization tool for the block layer IO tracing tool called
blktrace(8).  As noted in its documentation, blktrace 
is a block layer IO tracing mechanism which provides detailed
information about request queue operations up to user space.

bno_plot utilizes gnuplot to generate a 3D plot of the block number output from
btt.  If no \fI<files>\fR are specified, it will utilize all files generated after
btt was run with \fI-B blknos\fR (meaning: all files of the form \fIblknos*[rw].dat\fR).

The \fI-K\fR option forces bno_plot to put the keys below the graph.  If it is
not specified, all keys for input files are put in the upper right corner of the
graph. If the number of devices exceed 10, then bno_plot will automatically
push the keys under the graph.

To use this utility, the gnuplot package needs to be installed.

To exit the plotter, enter 'quit' or ^D at the 'gnuplot> ' prompt.
