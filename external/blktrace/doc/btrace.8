.SH NAME
btrace \- perform live tracing for block devices


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B btrace [\-s] [\-t] [\-w \fIN\fN] [\-n \fIN\fR] [\-b \fIN\fR] [\-r \fI<dbg mnt>\fR] [\-a <\fItrace\fR>...] <\fIdev\fR>...

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fIbtrace\fR script provides a quick and easy way to do live tracing of
block devices.  It calls \fIblktrace\fR on the specified devices
and pipes the output through \fIblkparse\fR for formatting.  See blktrace (8)
for more in-depth information about how \fIblktrace\fR works.  

.SH OPTIONS

.HP 4
.B \-s
Displays data sorted by program (see \fIblkparse\fR (1)).

.HP 4
.B \-t 
Displays time deltas per IO (see \fIblkparse\fR (1)).

.HP 4
.B \-w \fIN\fR
Sets run time to the number of seconds specified (see \fIblktrace\fR (8)).

.HP 4
.B \-n \fIN\fR
Specifies the number of buffers to use (see \fIblktrace\fR (8)).

.HP 4
.B \-b \fIN\fR
Specifies buffer size for event extraction (scaled by 1024) (see
\fIblktrace\fR (8)).

.HP 4
.B \-r \fI<dbg mnt>\fR
Specifies the debugfs mountpoint.

.HP 4
.B \-a <\fItrace\fR>...
Adds mask to current filter (see \fIblktrace\fR (8)).

.HP 4
.B <\fIdev\fR>
Specifies the device to trace.


.SH EXAMPLE
Simply running

    % btrace /dev/sda

will show a trace of the device \fI/dev/sda\fR.
