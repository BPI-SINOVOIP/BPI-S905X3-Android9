Hacking on Minijail:

-Minijail uses kernel coding style: http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/Documentation/CodingStyle

-Utility functions with no side-effects should go in util.{h|c}.

-Functions with side effects or with dependencies on operating system details,
but that don't take a 'struct minijail' argument, should go in system.{h|c}.
