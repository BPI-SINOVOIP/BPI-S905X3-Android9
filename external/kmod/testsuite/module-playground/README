Pre-compiled modules
====================

Some modules are pre-compiled due to needing cross-compilers present on the
build/dev machine which is inconvenient. Makefile is ready to compile them again
in case they are missing:

1) Prepare the linux kernel trees to build external modules, i.e.:

   kernel $ make ARCH=<arch> CROSS_COMPILER=<cross-compiler-prefix> defconfig
   kernel $ make ARCH=<arch> CROSS_COMPILER=<cross-compiler-prefix> modules_prepare

   For each architecture. See the Makefile to check which are the supported architectures.

2) Export the variables below to point to the right place:

   KDIR_<arch>:                for each architecture it needs to point to a
                               kernel tree configured as in (1)

   CROSS_COMPILER_<arch:       for each architecture it needs to point to the
			       correct toolchain prefix. Leave it blank if a
			       cross-compiler is not needed (example: you are
			       building a 32b module with a multilib compiler).


3) Remove every %-<arch>.ko. After this the build system will recreate them.
