.SH NAME
capng_apply \- apply the stored capabilities settings
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B #include <cap-ng.h>
.sp
int capng_apply(capng_select_t set);

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

capng_apply will transfer the specified internal posix capabilities settings to the kernel. The options are CAPNG_SELECT_CAPS for the traditional capabilities, CAPNG_SELECT_BOUNDS for the bounding set, or CAPNG_SELECT_BOTH if transferring both is desired. 

.SH "RETURN VALUE"

This returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.

.SH NOTES

If you are doing multi-threaded programming, calling this function will only set capabilities on the calling thread. All other threads are unaffected. If you want to set overall capabilities for a multi-threaded process, you will need to do that before creating any threads. See the capset syscall for more information on this topic.
