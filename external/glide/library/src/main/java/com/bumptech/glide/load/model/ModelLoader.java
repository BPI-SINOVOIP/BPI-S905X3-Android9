/**
 * A factory interface for translating an arbitrarily complex data model into a concrete data type that can be used
 * by an {@link DataFetcher} to obtain the data for a resource represented by the model.
 *
 * <p>
 *  This interface has two objectives:
 *   1. To translate a specific model into a data type that can be decoded into a resource.
 *
 *   2. To allow a model to be combined with the dimensions of the view to fetch a resource of a specific size.
 *
 *      This not only avoids having to duplicate dimensions in xml and in your code in order to determine the size of a
 *      view on devices with different densities, but also allows you to use layout weights or otherwise
 *      programatically set the dimensions of the view without forcing you to fetch a generic resource size.
 *
 *      The smaller the resource you fetch, the less bandwidth and battery life you use, and the lower your memory
 *      footprint per resource.
 *</p>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the model.
 * @param <Y> The type of the data that can be used by a {@link com.bumptech.glide.load.ResourceDecoder} to decode a
 *           resource.

     *     Note - If no valid data fetcher can be returned (for example if a model has a null URL), then it is
