This directory exists to hold the file
pregenerated/res/com/vladium/emma/rt/RTExitHook.closure, which is normally
deposited in the out/ directory during a standard Emma Ant build, but the
Android make-based build doesn't accommodate source-generation.

This is a hack, but it's convenient to keep Emma's own build system working
alongside Android's make-basedsystem.
