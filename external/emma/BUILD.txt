REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- JDK1.4 (the build will not work in JDK1.5)
- Apache ANT 1.5+ (official build uses v1.6.1)

BUILDING EMMA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- cd into the directory containing build.xml and create a file
  "build.properties" that tells the build where your JDK and ANT are located:

    - if Java 1.4 is not your currently installed Java version, set the
      following property to point to the "jre" subdirectory of your JDK 1.4
      install:

build.target.j2se.14.home = <JDK 1.4 install>/jre

    - if you don't have ANT_HOME environment variable set up to point to ANT
    1.5 home directory, set the following property:

build.target.ant.15.home = <ANT 1.5 install dir> 

- From the directory containing build.xml, execute:

>ant

- After a successful build, EMMA jars will be located in
  ${basedir}/${dist.dir}, which defaults to ./dist


- To remove all generated build artifacts and reset the build to a clean
  state, execute:

>ant clean
