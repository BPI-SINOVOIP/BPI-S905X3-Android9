This release contains a lot of bug fixes and a few new features.  It also 
includes the first phase of Distributed TestNG, a work in progress designed 
to transparently distribute tests on many machines and collect their results.

Announcing TestNG 2.3

The TestNG team is happy to announce the availability of TestNG 2.3.

The version is available at http://beust.com/testng as well as the new documentation, which has been considerably improved (highlighted code snippets, detailed DTD, ant task and description of all the new features).

What's new:

    * beforeSuite, afterSuite, beforeTest, afterTest
    * Revamped ant task with haltonfailure and other helpful flags
    * Better stack traces and improved level control for verbosity
    * Better syntax for including and excluding methods in testng.xml
    * Test classes can be invoked on the command line
    * ... and many bug fixes.

For Eclipse users, a new version (1.1.1) of the Eclipse plug-in that includes this new TestNG version is available on the remote update site or for direct download.

Also, TestNG has joined OpenSymphony (big thanks to Patrick and Hani for setting this up).  As a consequence of this move, there is now a TestNG users forum as well as a Wiki and JIRA for issue tracking.

The users mailing-list has been moved to Google Groups and is connected to the forum, so you only need to subscribe to one.

Try it and let us know what you think!

I am happy to announce the availability of TestNG 2.1 (http://beust.com/testng).  

TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use, such as:

    * JSR 175 Annotations (JDK 1.4 is also supported with JavaDoc annotations).
    * Flexible test configuration.
    * Default JDK functions for runtime and logging (no dependencies).
    * Powerful execution model (no more TestSuite).
    * Supports dependent methods.

Some of the new features in this version include:

    * invocationCount and successPercentage, which I described in a previous entry (http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000236.html), and which allow you to invoke a test method a certain number of times while allowing some of these invocations to fail.  If the number of failures is under a certain threshold, the test is still considered a success.
       
    * timeOut is now applicable to all test methods.  Whether you are running your tests in parallel or not, you can specify a time-out for your test method and if it fails to complete within the given amount of time, TestNG will mark it as a failure.
       
    * dependsOnMethods was the most requested feature.  You can now specify dependencies on a method-based basis (no need to specify a group if your dependency graph is simple).  You can even mix dependsOnMethods and dependsOnGroups.
       
    * ... and of course, numerous bug fixes and other additions.

A special thanks to Alexandru Popescu who has pulled all-nighters to make this release happen!

We have an exciting list of new features lined up for our next version, among which a plug-in API, but in the meantime, enjoy TestNG 2.1.

This first release covers the basic functionalities of TestNG, among which:

    * Multiple ways to launch tests (from a method, from a class, groups or an entire suite).
    * Convenient report view that lets you directly jump to failed tests.
