  Apply Serhiy Storchaka's update_idletasks solution to four test files.
  Record this additional advice in idle_test/README.txt

- Issue #20567: Revise idle_test/README.txt with advice about avoiding
  tk warning messages from tests.  Apply advice to several IDLE tests.

- Issue 15348: Stop the debugger engine (normally in a user process)
  before closing the debugger window (running in the IDLE process).
  This prevents the RuntimeErrors that were being caught and ignored.

- Issue #24455: Prevent IDLE from hanging when a) closing the shell while the
  debugger is active (15347); b) closing the debugger with the [X] button
  (15348); and c) activating the debugger when already active (24455).
  The patch by Mark Roseman does this by making two changes.
  1. Suspend and resume the gui.interaction method with the tcl vwait
  mechanism intended for this purpose (instead of root.mainloop & .quit).
  2. In gui.run, allow any existing interaction to terminate first.

- Change 'The program' to 'Your program' in an IDLE 'kill program?' message

  To use it with IDLEs released before November 2015, hit the
  'Save as New Custom Theme' button and enter a new name,
  such as 'Custom Dark'.  The custom theme will work with any IDLE
  release, and can be modified.

- Issue #25224: README.txt is now an idlelib index for IDLE developers and
  curious users.  The previous user content is now in the IDLE doc chapter.

  Settings -> Custom Highlighting.  Original patch by Mark Roseman.

  background, as configured by users, on all systems.  Found items are now
