 * CommandHandler for the NLST command. Return the configured directory listing on the data

 * another of 226. By default, return an empty directory listing. You can customize the 
 * returned directory listing by setting the <code>directoryListing</code> property.

 * Each invocation record stored by this CommandHandler includes the following data element key/values:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>{@link #PATHNAME_KEY} ("pathname") - the pathname of the directory (or file) submitted on the 
 *          invocation (the first command parameter); this parameter is optional, so the value may be null.
