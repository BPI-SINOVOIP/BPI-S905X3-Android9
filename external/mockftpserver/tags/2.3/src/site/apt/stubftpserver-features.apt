				StubFtpServer Features and Limitations
		--------------------------------------------------

StubFtpServer Features

  * Standalone dummy FTP server. Run either within the same JVM as test code or in a different JVM.

  * Implements common FTP server commands. See {{{stubftpserver-commandhandlers.html}FTP Commands and CommandHandlers}}.
  
  * Supports active and passive mode data transfers.

  * Works out of the box with reasonable defaults: success reply codes and empty data.
  
  * Easy to configure command handlers for individual FTP server commands to return success/failure reply codes and custom data.
  
  * Can verify expected FTP server command invocations.
  
  * Easy to implement command handlers for other commands or replace existing command handlers.

  * Use a dynamically chosen free port number for the server control port instead of using the default (21)
    or hard-coding some other value (set the serverControlPort property of the server to 0).

  * Fully supports configuration within the <<Spring Framework>>.
  
  * Can be used to test FTP client code written in any language
  

StubFtpServer Limitations

  * Using <<StubFtpServer>> for testing and simulation of non-default scenarios requires
    some understanding of the FTP Specification and a configuration of the low-level
    FTP Server commands.
