MockFtpServer

  The <<MockFtpServer>> project provides a mock/dummy FTP server implementation that can be very 
  useful for testing of FTP client code. It can be configured to return custom data or reply codes, 
  to simulate either success or failure scenarios. Expected command invocations can also be verified. 

  <<MockFtpServer>> is written in Java, and is ideally suited to testing Java code. But because 
  communication with the FTP server is across the network using sockets, it can be used to test FTP client 
  code written in any language.

  The <<MockFtpServer>> project may one day provide multiple mock/dummy FTP server implementations,
  at different levels of abstraction. Currently, however, <<StubFtpServer>> is the only one provided, 
  though others are being considered. <<StubFtpServer>> is a "stub" implementation of an FTP server. 
  See the {{{stubftpserver-getting-started.html}StubFtpServer Getting Started Guide}} for more information.

  For projects built using {{{http://maven.apache.org/}Maven}}, <<MockFtpServer>> is now available 
  from the <<Maven Central Repository>>. Add a dependency to your POM like this:

--------------------
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.mockftpserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>MockFtpServer</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>
