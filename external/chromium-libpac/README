This library is based on the proxy_resolver_v8 and other classes taken from 
chromium project.

Modifications have been made to remove dependencies on chromium utility
functions and classes.  To make this library accessible on Android, the string 
utilities have been modified to use stl and the network functions have been 
modified to use UNIX functions.
