This directory contains a script that converts the javascript directory
to a header file containing strings for use with testing.

Do not modify proxy_script_test.h.  Instead modify the files contained
within js-unittest/ and then run the following command.
    ./jstocstring.pl js-unittest proxy_test_script.h
