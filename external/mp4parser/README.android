Description: "Provides a Java API for parsing MP4 files"

Local Modifications:
    Only taking the isoparser/src/main/ part, remove others.
    Remove the RequiresParseDetailAspect.java file since we don't have the aspectJ yet.

Originally written by Sebastian Annies, this isoparser API can read and write
the MP4 file structure. It is a low level tool dealing with the so called boxes
but it is as well as dealing with structure like tracks and movies.

This code is built as a static library.
