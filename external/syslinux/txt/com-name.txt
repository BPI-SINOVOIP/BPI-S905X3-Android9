// == NAMING CONVENTION ==

As of 3.73, a standard for naming conventions was adopted to more
clearly distinguish different aspects.  The moniker "The *Syslinux*
Project", in standard proper noun capitalization, shall be used to refer
to the project as a whole. The all-caps form shall be used to refer to a
particular loader variant such as "*SYSLINUX*" for the standard disk
(floppy/hard disk; formerly just FAT) loader.  The all-lower case form
should be used to refer to a particular installer such as
"syslinux-mtools" for the mtools-based installer for *SYSLINUX*.
