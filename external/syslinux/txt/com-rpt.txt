// == BUG REPORTS ==

I would appreciate hearing of any problems you have with Syslinux.  I
would also like to hear from you if you have successfully used Syslinux,
*especially* if you are using it for a distribution.

If you are reporting problems, please include all possible information
about your system and your BIOS; the vast majority of all problems
reported turn out to be BIOS or hardware bugs, and I need as much
information as possible in order to diagnose the problems.

There is a mailing list for discussion among Syslinux users and for
announcements of new and test versions.  To join, or to browse the
archive, go to:

Please DO NOT send HTML messages or attachments to the mailing list
(including multipart/alternative or similar.)  All such messages will be
bounced.
