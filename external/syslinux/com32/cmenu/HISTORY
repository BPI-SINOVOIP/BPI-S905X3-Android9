GCC & 32-bit code
-----------------
Due to the limitations of the COM file format,
(64KB limit on memory footprint) the code has been changed
so that the code compiles to a 32-bit COMBOOT program.
Since the code makes use of BIOS calls, this code cannot be
compiled into a format which can execute under Linux. As a
side effect, there is no nice way to debug this code. In order
to debug this code, you will have to run the code under syslinux.

GCC & 16-bit code
-----------------
The code was ported to GCC by Peter Anvin.

OpenWatcom & 16-bit code
------------------------
Originally this code was written for the Openwatcom compiler
and generated .COM files, which could execute under DOS as well as
SYSLINUX.
