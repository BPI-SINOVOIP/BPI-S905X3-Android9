To build HDT, you just have to do a "make" call in this directory.

Creating a bootable floppy
--------------------------
To build a bootable HDT floppy image, you can do a "make hdt.img" call.
This will requires the mtools (http://mtools.linux.lu) to be installed.
The script will try to pick several files from your system :
- /lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.alias
- /lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.pcimap
- /usr/share/pci.ids or /usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids

This paths can be overrided with the following command line:
make MODULES_ALIAS_FILE=$(PWD)/floppy/modules.alias MODULES_PCIMAP_FILE=$(PWD)/floppy/modules.pcimap PCI_IDS_FILE=$(PWD)/floppy/pci.ids hdt.img

If your system doesn't have pci.ids, please download it from http://pciids.sourceforge.net/ and put it into the floppy/ directory.
