 * Maxmimum advertised TCP window size

 * We estimate the TCP window size as the amount of free memory we

 * already allocated as RX buffers), but it will do for now.
 *
 * Since we don't store out-of-order received packets, the
 * retransmission penalty is that the whole window contents must be
 * resent.  This suggests keeping the window size small, but bear in
 * mind that the maximum bandwidth on any link is limited to
 *
 *    max_bandwidth = ( tcp_window / round_trip_time )
 *
 * With a 48kB window, which probably accurately reflects our amount
 * of free memory, and a WAN RTT of say 200ms, this gives a maximum
 * bandwidth of 240kB/s.  This is sufficiently close to realistic that
 * we will need to be careful that our advertised window doesn't end
 * up limiting WAN download speeds.
 *
 * Finally, since the window goes into a 16-bit field and we cannot
 * actually use 65536, we use a window size of (65536-4) to ensure
 * that payloads remain dword-aligned.
