/**
 * A hook for monitoring the execution of individual {@linkplain Produces producer methods}. See
 * {@link ProductionComponentMonitor} for how to install these monitors.
 *
 * <p>The lifecycle of the monitor, under normal conditions, is:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #methodStarting()}
 *   <li>The method is called
 *   <li>{@link #methodFinished()}
 *   <li>If the method returns a value, then:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #succeeded(Object)} if the method returned normally; or
 *     <li>{@link #failed(Throwable)} if the method threw an exception.
 *   </ul>
 *   <li>If the method returns a future, then:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #succeeded(Object)} if the method returned normally, and the future succeeded; or
 *     <li>{@link #failed(Throwable)} if the method threw an exception, or returned normally and the
 *         future failed.
 *   </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If any input to the monitored producer fails, {@link #failed(Throwable)} will be called
 * immediately with the failed input's exception. If more than one input fails, an arbitrary failed
 * input's exception is used.
 *
 * <p>If any of the monitor's methods throw, then the exception will be logged and processing will
 * continue unaffected.
