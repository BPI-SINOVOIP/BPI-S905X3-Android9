Description: "Dagger 2 - A fast dependency injector for Android and Java"

Version: 91f7d8bda5b1ef2fdf768758c88d3e5f069210ea

Upstream depends (slightly) on Guava v19 but we only have Guava v18 in
Android at the moment so we have reverted those changes that introduced
a dependency on Guava v19.

Local Patches:
    Revert "Stop using deprecated Futures method." - upstream 0a2ca81c0f78c621968deb58f4b42117db43fec4
