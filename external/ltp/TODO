LTP TODO
--------


Write more syscall tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Syscalls and new syscall flags are added to Linux kernel each development cycle
and LTP still falls behind. Unfortunately there is no single place that would
store comprehensive list of syscalls, but there are a few places to look at:

One of the options would be looking at changes in man-pages git[1] in man2/
directory to find out newly documented functionality.

Another good source of information are kernel pages in LWN[2] weekly
editions.

Then there is linux-api mailing list[3] where changes in kernel userspace API
should be discussed.

Rewrite old and add new controller testcases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We already started working on this with rewriting cgroup_fj testcases and
newly added pids testcases. Have a look at testcases/kernel/controllers/.


Shell tests cleanups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are numerous testcases written in shell that does not follow single style
and use the broken-by-design binaries from tools/apicmds. These should be
cleaned up and fixed to use the test.sh test library. These include most of
tests in testcases/commands/ for example.
