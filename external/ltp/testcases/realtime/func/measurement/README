These tests (preempt_timing and rdtsc_latency) are intended
to be tools to diagnose problems if gtod_latency results are
problematic.

We don't run these tests by default (top level run.sh script
will not list them, as it won't find run_auto.sh).

They can be run from this test directly by invoking the
local run.sh script.
