*Decided not to test this assertion.  It seems like a lot of work for little
payoff in terms of if the test passes.  Would need to:  Get the resolution;
Set the time to desired value + 1/2 resolution time.  Get the time.  Ensure
that time gotten isn't too much larger than desired value + resolution time.
Depending on execution time of the test, this could never really be
conclusive.

The date chosen for all tests is November 12, 2002 at ~11:13am (The
date when these tests were first written.)
