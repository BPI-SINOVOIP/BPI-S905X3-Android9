This document defines the coverage of testing for all assertions.

Assertion	Tested?
1		YES - Noticing interesting things in the amount of time
			actually slept.  Maybe should investigate this
			further.
2		YES
3		YES
4		YES
5		YES
6		YES
7		YES - Decided not to test when rmtp = NULL.  Seems not
			relevant.
10000 (bounds)	YES - Made tests for a variety of boundary conditions.


The algorithm for calculating the amount of time slept is noted below.
[Used in 1-1.c, 2-1.c, 10000-1.c]

STARTSEC, STARTNSEC = the start time, seconds and nanoseconds, respectively
FINISHSEC, FINISHNSEC = the finish time, seconds and nanoseconds, respectively
slepts, sleptns = amount of seconds and nanoseconds slept, respectively

slepts=FINISHSEC - STARTSEC;
sleptns=FINISHNSEC - STARTNSEC;
if (sleptns < 0) {
	sleptns = sleptns+1000000000;
	slepts = slepts-1;
}
