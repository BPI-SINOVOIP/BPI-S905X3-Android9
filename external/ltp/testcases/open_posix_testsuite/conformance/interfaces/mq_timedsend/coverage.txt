This file defines the coverage for mq_timedsend.

Note:  Most tests in mq_timedsend() are cut and pastes from mq_send.
Due to the structure of the test suite, there wasn't a better, quick way
I could find to reduce this redundancy.

Note 2:  These tests assume that the TMR functionality isn't implemented.
If it is, the time() calls should be replaced with clock_gettime().
