The following values will be used for boundary testing:

Note:  These numbers are not magical just the ones a gcc compiler gave on
a certain compilation of a test program.

Potentially the MAX+1/MIN-1 values are deterministic.  The others are just
empirical examples.

To simulate:       Use:
INT32_MAX+1       -2147483647 (gcc compiler gave -2147483648)
INT32_MIN-1        2147483647
unassigned val    -1073743192
unassigned val     1075002478
