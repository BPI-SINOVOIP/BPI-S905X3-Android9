This document defines the coverage for the pthread_attr_destroy function:

Assertion	Tested?
1		YES *Fails on the implementation of threads that I'm working
		     on.
2		YES
3		YES

Note: pthread_attr_destroy leaves a lot up to the implementation of threads
that you are testing on.  For instance, on the implementation that I'm working
on, pthread_attr_destroy() does nothing.
