  <assertion id="1" tag="ref:XSH6:6514:6519">
   clock() returns a clock_t containing the processor time since a specific
   point in time (implementation defined).
   This return value should be divided by CLOCKS_PER_SEC to get the time
   in seconds.
  </assertion>
  <assertion id="2" tag="ref:XSH6:6519:6519 pt:XSI">
   CLOCKS_PER_SEC == 1,000,000 in time.h
  </assertion>
  <assertion id="3" tag="ref:XSH6:6520:6521">
   clock() returns (clock_t) - 1 if the processor time used cannot be
   represented or is somehow unavailable
  </assertion>
  <assertion id="4" tag="ref:XSH6:6527:6530">
   clock() is best used to get a delta between two times in a program.
  </assertion>
  <assertion id="5" tag="ref:XSH6:6531:6532">
   It is acceptable for clock() to wrap on some implementations.  (No
   specifics on when/where.)
