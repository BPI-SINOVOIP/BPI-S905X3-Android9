This file defines the coverage for the kill() function testing.

Assertion	Status
1		DONE
2		DONE - Open questions on assumptions
3		DONE - Note:  This has a bug.  The child doesn't die; it sits in constant wait.  TBD how to fix (I tried adding another layer, but can't figure out how to kill the child without killing everything, so nothing is checked in.)
4		IMPLICITLY tested by assertion 1
5		NOT STARTED
6		NOT STARTED
7		NOT STARTED
8		NOT STARTED
9		NOT STARTED
10		WON'T test. This assertion cannot really be tested; however, it is listed
		as an FYI for the tester in that the assertion may cause some
		items which could be perceived as failures to actually be
		passes.
