DEFINITIONS TESTING
===================
A variety of header file definitions are listed in the POSIX Base Definitions
document.  The steps below describe how to test the various types of
definitions that appear.

Definitions Testing -> STRUCTURES
---------------------------------
To test that a structure has been correctly defined, we add two tests into
one .c file.  The first test tests that the structure has been declared, and
the second that all elements of the structure are correctly defined.

To make the first test and setup the second, delcare the structure as:

struct <structure under test> this_type_should_exist, t;

To make the second test, create a dummy function and assign elements of
the correct structure to t or assign t to certain elements:

int dummyfcn (void)
{
	t.<field> = <value>;
	<variable> = t.<field>;
}

For assignment, some rules of thumb are:
- For variables of a defined type, assign t.<field> to these values.
ex.
sigset_t *set;
set = &t.sa_mask;

- For variables which are other functions, assign a function to t.<field>.
ex.
extern void signal_handler(int);
t.sa_handler = signal_handler;

For examples, see posixtestsuite/conformance/definitions/signal/15-1.c

Definitions Testing -> MACROS
-----------------------------
Macros are tested to see if they are defined.  This is done via the
#ifdef preprocessor lines.

ex.
#include <include file with definitions.h>

#ifndef <Macro name>
#error <Macro name> not defined
#endif

For examples, see posixtestsuite/conformance/definitions/signal/22-*.c

Definitions Testing -> FUNCTIONS
--------------------------------
To test functions, declare a typedef of a test function identical to the
function under test, create a variable of that typedef, and try to assign
it to the function under test.

ex.
typedef int (*fcn_test)(char *, char *);
int dummyfcn (void)
{
	fcn_test dummyvar;
	dummyvar = fcn;
	return 0;
}

For examples, see posixtestsuite/conformance/definitions/signal/43-1.c
