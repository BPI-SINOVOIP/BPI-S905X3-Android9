HOWTO Tag Software
==================

Releases of the POSIX Test Suite will happen at defined (TBD) intervals.
In order to get code included in the releases, the tagging scheme below
has been created.

Developer Tagging
=================
When the code a developer is working on is ready for a release, the developer
should tag it with the tag:
	posixtestsuite__source

This code will then be pulled to make the official release.

Note:  Before code should be considered to be ready for release, it should
follow all HOWTOs currently created.

Release Coordinator Tagging
===========================
The person responsible for gathering and tarring all the files for the
official release will grab all files with the posixtestsuite__source
tag and tag them with the tag:
	Release__M_N_P__posixtestsuite__YYMMDD
where M.N.P is the version number, and YYMMDD is the current date.

The version numbering scheme is as follows:

M = Major release.  The initial scope of the POSIX Test Suite corresponds
to M=1.  That includes tests for all initially scoped POSIX areas (signals,
threads, semaphores, message queues, timers).  M<1 is for releases before
the first major release.  M>1 will happen when the scope changes.

N = Minor release.  The various minor releases have yet to be determined,
but will most likely roughly correspond to the milestones defined.

P = Release number.  This is incremented each time a new release is made.
Restarts at 0 for each new Major/Minor combination.
