This document describes the coding guidelines for this project.

Since one of the most common uses of these API tests is to find bugs
with the Linux kernel and submit bug reports to the linux-kernel
mailing list with a pointer to the source code of the test case that
demonstrates the bug, it makes sense to follow the coding guidelines
followed by the Linux kernel.  These are available at:
http://www.purists.org/linux/ or in linux/Documentation/CodingStyle
in a Linux distribution.
