This directory contains two scripts and one data file to test cron. Both
shouldn't be run as root but they warn for themselves. If a username is
given as parameter they run as this user.

Both scripts save the current crontab and restore it after finishing.

* Positive tests

	cron_pos_tests.sh [username]

	- add new job
	- check correct execution of job
	- delete job

* Negative tests

	cron_neg_tests.sh [username]

	- try to edit the crontab of root
	- try to set illegal or nondefined execution times
	  Here the script uses file illegal_cron_lines which contains two
	  fields per line: the cron line to be tested (without script name),
	  and the description of this test. The description is written to
	  stdout during execution of the test.
	- try to do things you aren't allowed as non-root (cron runs as root)
