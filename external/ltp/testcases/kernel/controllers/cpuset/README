TEST SUITE:

The directory cpuset contains the tests related to the cpuset controller.

Cpuset is a mechanism for assigning a set of CPUs and Memory Nodes to a set of
tasks.

There are total 258 testcases that have been added till date. Now, These
testcases contain the basis operation test and part functionality test of
cpuset, such as: adding/removing cpus/mems, setting flags, exclusive function,
hierarchy relation, inherit relation, cpuset VS syscall and so on

NOTE: the test can be run by root only. And 4 CPUs and 3 Memory Nodes is need
to run it at least.

TESTS AIM:

The aim of the tests is to test the functionality of cpuset.

FILES DESCRIPTION:

cpuset_base_ops_test
--------------------
Directory containing the shell script which is used to test the basis
operation of cpuset. such as: adding/removing cpus/mems, setting flags.

cpuset_exclusive_test
---------------------
Directory containing the shell script which is used to test exclusive
function of cpuset.

cpuset_hierarchy_test
---------------------
Directory containing the shell script is used to test hierarchy relation
of cpuset.

cpuset_syscall_test
-------------------
Directory containing the shell script and program which are used to test
syscalls whether they collide with cpuset.

cpuset_hotplug_test
-------------------
Directory containing the shell script and program which are used to test
cpu hotplug whether they collide with cpuset.

cpuset_load_balance_test
------------------------
Directory containing the shell script and program which are used to test
scheduler domains partitions. Beside that, they are also used to check that
whether load balance breaks the cpuset's limit.

cpuset_memory_pressure_test
---------------------------
Directory containing the shell script and program which are used to test
memory pressure measurement function.

cpuset_memory_spread_test
-------------------------
Directory containing the shell script and program which are used to test
page caches spread. There are two control files. One is memory_spread_page which
is used to control the allocation of page caches, the other is
memory_spread_slab which is used to control the allocation of slab objects.
Because there are much factor to affect the result of slab spread test, it
is hard to test it. So we just test memory_spread_page.

cpuset_memory_test
------------------
Directory containing the shell script and program which are used to test
memory allocation.

cpuset_lib
----------
This directory contains the library and script for cpuset controller testing.
such as: cpuset_funcs.sh(functions for cpuset test script)

run_cpuset_test.sh
------------------
This script runs all the 190 testcases.

Makefile
--------
Each directory in cpuset has its usual makefile, it is for its directory.
