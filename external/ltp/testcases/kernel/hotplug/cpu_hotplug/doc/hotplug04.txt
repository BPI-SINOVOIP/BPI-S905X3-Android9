Testcase 04
-----------

This test verifies that we can't offline ALL of the CPUs in the system.
We do this by onlining all the cpus, then offlining all the cpus and
verifying that an error is returned for the last one.

Algorithm
=========
Loop until done:
  Take a snapshot of what CPUs are on and off initially

  Online all the CPUs

  Offline al the CPUs

  Restore system to initial state
