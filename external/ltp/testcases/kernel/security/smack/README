These testcases test the Smack Security Module. And they are not part of
default LTP build/install/run.

A kernel with Smack configured is required to run the Smack testsuite.
(Please see ltp/README for all those config options)
The smackfs filesystem must be mounted at /smack. One way to accomplish
this is to:
1) Create a directory first:
	mkdir -p /smack

2) Include this line in the /etc/fstab file:
	smackfs /smack smackfs defaults 0 0

3) Do:
	mount -a

4) Building/Installing the tests:
	Each test is designed to be independent. The tests can be built
using the default make target.
	(cd testcases/kernel/security/smack; make && make install)

5) Running the tests:
	./runltp -f smack

Each test exits with 0 on success and an error code on failure.
