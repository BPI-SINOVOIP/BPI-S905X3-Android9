TEST SUITE:

The directory prot_hsymlinks contains the tests related to harlinks and
symlinks restrictions.

TESTS AIM:

The aim of the tests is to check the restrictions
for hardlinks and symlinks.

This security restrictions were added in Linux 3.6 and enabled by default,
but it broke some programs. It has been disabled by default in Linux 3.7 and
to control it, special proc parameters added. Distributions and users
can enable it by writing "1" to /proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks,
/proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks.

This test enables restrictions and checks following preconditions:

1. Users who own sticky world-writable directory can't follow symlinks
inside that directory if their don't own ones. All other users can follow.

2. Hard links restriction applies only to non-privileged users. Only
non-privileged user can't create hard links to files if he isn't owner
of the file or he doesn't have write access to the file.
