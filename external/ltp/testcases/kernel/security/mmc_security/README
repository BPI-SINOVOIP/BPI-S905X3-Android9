MMC Password Protection Reference UI
------------------------------------

This is a simple text-mode reference UI for the MMC password protection
support, written in shell script. It's very simple and does not hash nor cache
passwords.

It's composed of the following files:

- ask_password.sh: get the password from userspace. It's called when unlocking
  the card or assigning a new password to an unlocked card.
- change_password.sh: used to change the password from a unlocked card.
- forced_erase.sh: used to force-erase a card, usually when the user has forgot
  the password and wants to unlock the card. NOTE: all the card's contents are
  lost when using this option! It only works for _locked_ cards.
- remove_password.sh: used to remove the passwor from a card previously unlocked.
