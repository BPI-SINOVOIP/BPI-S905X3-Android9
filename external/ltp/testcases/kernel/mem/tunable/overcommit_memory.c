 *
 * Descriptions:
 *
 * There are two tunables overcommit_memory and overcommit_ratio under
 * /proc/sys/vm/, which can control memory overcommitment.
 *
 * The overcommit_memory contains a flag that enables memory
 * overcommitment, it has three values:
 * - When this flag is 0, the kernel attempts to estimate the amount
 *   of free memory left when userspace requests more memory.
 * - When this flag is 1, the kernel pretends there is always enough
 *   memory until it actually runs out.
 * - When this flag is 2, the kernel uses a "never overcommit" policy
 *   that attempts to prevent any overcommit of memory.
 *
 * The overcommit_ratio tunable defines the amount by which the kernel
 * overextends its memory resources in the event that overcommit_memory
 * is set to the value of 2. The value in this file represents a
 * percentage added to the amount of actual RAM in a system when
 * considering whether to grant a particular memory request.
 * The general formula for this tunable is:
 * CommitLimit = SwapTotal + MemTotal * overcommit_ratio
 * CommitLimit, SwapTotal and MemTotal can read from /proc/meminfo.
 *
 * The program is designed to test the two tunables:
 *
 * When overcommit_memory = 0, allocatable memory can't overextends
 * the amount of free memory. I choose the three cases:
 * a. less than free_total:    free_total / 2, alloc should pass.
 * b. greater than free_total: free_total * 2, alloc should fail.
 * c. equal to sum_total:      sum_tatal,      alloc should fail
 *
 * When overcommit_memory = 1, it can alloc enough much memory, I
 * choose the three cases:
 * a. less than sum_total:    sum_total / 2, alloc should pass
 * b. equal to sum_total:     sum_total,     alloc should pass
 * c. greater than sum_total: sum_total * 2, alloc should pass
 * *note: sum_total = SwapTotal + MemTotal
 *
 * When overcommit_memory = 2, the total virtual address space on
 * the system is limited to CommitLimit(Swap+RAM*overcommit_ratio)
 * commit_left(allocatable memory) = CommitLimit - Committed_AS
 * a. less than commit_left:    commit_left / 2, alloc should pass
 * b. greater than commit_left: commit_left * 2, alloc should fail
 * c. overcommit limit:         CommitLimit,     alloc should fail
 * *note: CommitLimit is the current overcommit limit.
 *        Committed_AS is the amount of memory that system has used.
 * it couldn't choose 'equal to commit_left' as a case, because
 * commit_left rely on Committed_AS, but the Committed_AS is not stable.
