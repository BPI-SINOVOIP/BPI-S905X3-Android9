 *
 * Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM) for Memory Resource Controller and NUMA
 *
 * Basic tests were to start several programs with same and different
 * memory contents and ensure only to merge the ones with the same
 * contents. When changed the content of one of merged pages in a
 * process and to the mode "unmerging", it should discard all merged
 * pages there. Also tested it is possible to disable KSM. There are
 * also command-line options to specify the memory allocation size, and
 * number of processes have same memory contents so it is possible to
 * test more advanced things like KSM + OOM etc.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 *
 * 1) ksm and ksmtuned daemons need to be disabled. Otherwise, it could
 *    distrub the testing as they also change some ksm tunables depends
 *    on current workloads.
 *
 * The test steps are:
 * - Check ksm feature and backup current run setting.
 * - Change run setting to 1 - merging.
 * - 3 memory allocation programs have the memory contents that 2 of
 *   them are all 'a' and one is all 'b'.
 * - Check ksm statistics and verify the content.
 * - 1 program changes the memory content from all 'a' to all 'b'.
 * - Check ksm statistics and verify the content.
 * - All programs change the memory content to all 'd'.
 * - Check ksm statistics and verify the content.
 * - Change one page of a process.
 * - Check ksm statistics and verify the content.
 * - Change run setting to 2 - unmerging.
 * - Check ksm statistics and verify the content.
 * - Change run setting to 0 - stop.
