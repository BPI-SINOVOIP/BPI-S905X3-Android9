/*
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	hugeshmat01 - test that shmat() works correctly
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	create a large shared memory resouce with read/write permissions
 *	loop if that option was specified
 *	call shmat() with the TEST() macro using three valid conditions
 *	check the return code
 *	  if failure, issue a FAIL message.
 *	otherwise,
 *	  if doing functionality testing
 *		check for the correct conditions after the call
 *		if correct,
 *			issue a PASS message
 *		otherwise
 *			issue a FAIL message
 *	call cleanup
 *

 *	03/2001 - Written by Wayne Boyer
