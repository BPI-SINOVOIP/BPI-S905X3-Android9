/*
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	hugeshmdt01 - check that largr shared memory is detached correctly
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	create a large shared memory resource
 *	attach it to the current process and give it a value
 *	call shmdt() using the TEST macro
 *	check the return code
 *	  if failure, issue a FAIL message.
 *	otherwise,
 *	  if doing functionality testing
 *		attempt to write a value to the large shared memory address
 *		this should generate a SIGSEGV which will be caught in
 *		    the signal handler
 *		if correct,
 *			issue a PASS message
 *		otherwise
 *			issue a FAIL message
 *	call cleanup
 *

 *	03/2001 - Written by Wayne Boyer
