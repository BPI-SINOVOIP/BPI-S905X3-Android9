 *   DESCRIPTION
 *     This case does functional SEEK_HOLE and SEEK_DATA of lseek(2) testing.
 *
 *     Since version 3.1, Linux supports the following additional values for
 *     whence:
 *
 *     SEEK_DATA
 *         Adjust the file offset to the next location in the file greater than
 *         or  equal  to  offset  containing data.  If offset points to data,
 *         then the file offset is set to offset.
 *
 *     SEEK_HOLE
 *         Adjust the file offset to the next hole in the file greater than or
 *         equal to offset.  If offset points into the middle of a hole, then
 *         the file offset is set to offset. If there is no hole past offset,
 *         then the file offset is adjusted to the end of the file (i.e., there
 *         is an implicit hole at the end of any file).
