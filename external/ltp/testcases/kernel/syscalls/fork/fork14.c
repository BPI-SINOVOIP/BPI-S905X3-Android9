 * This test is a reporducer for this patch:
 *              https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/4/24/328
 * Since vma length in dup_mmap is calculated and stored in a unsigned
 * int, it will overflow when length of mmaped memory > 16 TB. When
 * overflow occur, fork will  incorrectly succeed. The patch above
 * fixed it.
