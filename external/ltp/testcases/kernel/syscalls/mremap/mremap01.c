/*
 * Test Name: mremap01
 *
 * Test Description:
 *  Verify that, mremap() succeeds when used to expand the existing
 *  virtual memory mapped region to the requested size where the
 *  virtual memory area was previously mapped to a file using mmap().
 *
 * Expected Result:
 *  mremap() should succeed returning the address of new virtual memory area.
 *  The expanded mapped memory region should be accessible and able to
 *  synchronize with the file.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *  Setup:
 *   Setup signal handling.
 *   Create temporary directory.
 *   Pause for SIGUSR1 if option specified.
 *
 *  Test:
 *   Loop if the proper options are given.
 *   Execute system call
 *   Check return code, if system call failed (return=-1)
 *	Log the errno and Issue a FAIL message.
 *   Otherwise,
 *	Verify the Functionality of system call
 *      if successful,
 *		Issue Functionality-Pass message.
 *      Otherwise,
 *		Issue Functionality-Fail message.
 *  Cleanup:
 *   Print errno log and/or timing stats if options given
 *   Delete the temporary directory created.
 *
 * Usage:  <for command-line>
 *  mremap01 [-c n] [-f] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *     where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *             -f   : Turn off functionality Testing.
 *	       -i n : Execute test n times.
 *	       -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *	       -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *	       -t   : Turn on syscall timing.

 * HISTORY
 *	07/2001 Ported by Wayne Boyer
 *
 *      11/09/2001 Manoj Iyer (manjo@austin.ibm.com)
 *	Modified.
 *	- #include <linux/mman.h> should not be included as per man page for
 *	  mremap, #include <sys/mman.h> alone should do the job. But inorder
 *	  to include definition of MREMAP_MAYMOVE defined in bits/mman.h
 *	  (included by sys/mman.h) __USE_GNU needs to be defined.
 *	  There may be a more elegant way of doing this...
 *
 * RESTRICTIONS:
 *  None.
