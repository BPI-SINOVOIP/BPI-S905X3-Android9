/*
 * Test Name: munmap01
 *
 * Test Description:
 *  Verify that, munmap call will succeed to unmap a mapped file or
 *  anonymous shared memory region from the calling process's address space
 *  and after successful completion of munmap, the unmapped region is no
 *  longer accessible.
 *
 * Expected Result:
 *  munmap call should succeed to unmap a mapped file or anonymous shared
 *  memory region from the process's address space and it returns with a
 *  value 0, further reference to the unmapped region should result in a
 *  segmentation fault (SIGSEGV).
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *  Setup:
 *   Setup signal handling.
 *   Create temporary directory.
 *   Pause for SIGUSR1 if option specified.
 *
 *  Test:
 *   Loop if the proper options are given.
 *   Execute system call
 *   Check return code, if system call failed (return=-1)
 *   	Log the errno and Issue a FAIL message.
 *   Otherwise,
 *   	Verify the Functionality of system call
 *      if successful,
 *      	Issue Functionality-Pass message.
 *      Otherwise,
 *		Issue Functionality-Fail message.
 *  Cleanup:
 *   Print errno log and/or timing stats if options given
 *   Delete the temporary directory created.
 *
 * Usage:  <for command-line>
 *  munmap01 [-c n] [-f] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *     where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *             -f   : Turn off functionality Testing.
 *	       -i n : Execute test n times.
 *	       -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *	       -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *	       -t   : Turn on syscall timing.
