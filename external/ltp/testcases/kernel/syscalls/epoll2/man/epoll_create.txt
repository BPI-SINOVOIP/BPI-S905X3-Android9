EPOLL_CREATE(2)            Linux Programmer's Manual           EPOLL_CREATE(2)



NAME
       epoll_create - open an epoll file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/epoll.h>

       int epoll_create(int size)

DESCRIPTION
       Open  an  epoll  file  descriptor  by requesting the kernel allocate an
       event backing store dimensioned for size descriptors. The size  is  not
       the  maximum  size  of  the backing store but just a hint to the kernel
       about how to dimension internal structures.  The returned file descrip-
       tor  will  be used for all the subsequent calls to the epoll interface.
       The file descriptor returned by epoll_create(2) must be closed by using
       close(2).

RETURN VALUE
       When successful, epoll_create(2) returns a positive integer identifying
       the descriptor.  When an error occurs, epoll_create(2) returns  -1  and
       errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       ENOMEM There was insufficient memory to create the kernel object.

CONFORMING TO
       epoll_create(2)  is  a  new API introduced in Linux kernel 2.5.44.  The
       interface should be finalized by Linux kernel 2.5.66.
