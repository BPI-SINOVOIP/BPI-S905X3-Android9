The aim of the test is to check device firmware loading. Since kernel 3.7
firmware loading changed to direct loading (by-pass udev). The test consists
of the two parts:
 - userspace part
 - kernelspace part

This is a kernel module, which is a part of the device firmware loading test.
It allows to call request_firmware kernel function with specified parameters.
Template firmware file name and expected firmware file's data size are passed
as the insmod command line parameters. Then, the number of firmware test files
should be written to sysfs file 'fwnum' (the maximum number is 32). This write
will initiate request firmware procedure. In the end, results can be read from
'result' device sysfs file. Also, some information regarding module loading,
can be obtained by looking at kernel log file.

It is automatically used by userspace part of the test.
