The aim of the test is to check device firmware loading. Since kernel 3.7
firmware loading changed to direct loading (by-pass udev). The test consists
of the two parts:
 - userspace part
 - kernelspace part

This is the userspace part, its tasks are:
 - create firmware files in the standard firmware paths
 - load the module and initiate firmware request procedure
 - read device's result file and print final results
 - unload the module.
