TEST SUITE:

The directory ext4-new-features contains the tests related to the ext4
filesystem's new features.

Ext4 is an advanced level of the ext3 filesystem which incorporates scalability
and reliability enhancements for supporting large filesystems(64 bit) in keeping
with increasing disk capacities and state-of-the-art feature requirements. More
extensive information of ext4 can be found at the ext4 wiki site at the URL:
http://ext4.wiki.kernel.org

There are total 117 testcases for ext4 new features test that have been added.
Now, these testcases can test multi-block alloc/delayed alloc, inode version
field on disk, journal checksumming, nanosec timestamps, online defrag, persist
prealloc, subdirectory limit and uninit groups of ext4.
The detail information of ext4 new features can be found at the URL:
http://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/New_ext4_features


TESTS AIM:

The aim of the tests is to test ext4 new features.


TEST STEPS:
# cd LTPROOT/testcases/kernel/fs/ext4-new-features
# make
# make install
# cd LTPROOT
# ./runltp -f fs_ext4 -z 'big unmounted block device partition'


NOTE:

1. This test can be run by root only.

2. These tests need a big unmounted block device partition. You MUST run runltp
   with "-z" option to specify such a big block device, if not, these tests
   will exit with TCONF.

   Be CAREFUL the data on the specified partition would be DESTROYED.

   The recommended size of partition is between 5G and 10G. If the partition is
   too big, the test will run for a long time, which is unnecessary.

3. Before starting test ext4 new features, please check whether ext4 filesystem
   is compiled into the kernel or not, and the kernel version is *2.6.31* or
   above.

4. A snapshot of config file options is given below:
   ONFIG_EXT4_FS=y
   CONFIG_EXT4DEV_COMPAT=y
   CONFIG_EXT4_FS_XATTR=y
   CONFIG_EXT4_FS_POSIX_ACL=y
   CONFIG_EXT4_FS_SECURITY=y

5. Beside that, the following packages are necessary:
   e2fsprogs
     (http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=e2fsprogs)
   e2fsprogs-devel
     (http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=e2fsprogs-devel)
   e2fsprogs-libs
     (http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=e2fsprogs-libs)
   and the version of these packages should be 1.41.4 or above, otherwise the
   test will fail.
