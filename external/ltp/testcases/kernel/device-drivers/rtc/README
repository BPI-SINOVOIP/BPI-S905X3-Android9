How to Build
------------
You have to build the complete LTP package before trying to build these tests.
After building the complete LTP sources enter this directory and issue a 'make'.

How to Run
----------

       The tests assume the rtc device node to be "/dev/rtc". If you have a
different node run the test with the name of the node as a parameter.

Eg. If your node is /dev/rtc0, then run the test as

       $ ./rtc-test /dev/rtc0
