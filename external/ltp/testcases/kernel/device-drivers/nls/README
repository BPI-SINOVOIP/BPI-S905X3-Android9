Native language support (nls) testsuite
---------------------------------------

The nls testsuite consists of a kernel space and a user space part. Currently
the kernel space part is compileable (tested with 2.6.27 & 2.6.28). Check the
top level README file in LTP to find out the kernel configuration dependencies
of this testsuite.

Before loading nlsTest.ko the nls_base.ko module must already be loaded.

Building
--------
To build nlsTest.ko you will need to have the the Linux kernel sources installed
on your build environment. Execute "make" from the current directory should
build the nlsTest.ko.

Executing the testsuite
-----------------------
The whole testsuite is executed automatically at module load time. You can
find the test results in the "dmesg" output.

Cleaning up
-----------
To clean up your test system can unload the nlsTest.ko module with
"rmmod nlsTest". To clean up your build system execute "make clean".
