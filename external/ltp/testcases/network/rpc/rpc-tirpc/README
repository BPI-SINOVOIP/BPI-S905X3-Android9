----------------------------
LTP modifications
----------------------------

The sources here are modified a bit to use the LTP wrapper - rpc_test.sh -
instead of a bunch of scripts from the above web page.

The basic group of test cases can be executed from
 * runtest/net.rpc_tests - for TS-RPC testing
 * runtest/net.tirpc_tests - for TI-RPC testing
using the LTP framework (ltp-pan, runltp and etc).

Additional test cases (like stress, complex and etc) are to be integrated.
