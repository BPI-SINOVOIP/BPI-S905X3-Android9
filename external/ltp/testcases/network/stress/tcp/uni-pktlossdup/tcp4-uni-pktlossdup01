# Description:
#   Verify that the kernel is not crashed with a unreliable connection to with
#   the following condition:
#     - The version of IP is IPv4
#     - Network is not delayed
#     - IPsec is not used
#     - Disable window scaling
#     - Enable Nagle algorithm
#     - Enable TCP Duplicate SACK support
#     - Enable SACK Support
#     - Some packets are lost
#     - Disable TSO if it is avalable
#
#   *) This script may be read by the other test case
