File overview.html in the current directory gives a very brief
overview of this project.  It also appears in the "Overview"
section of the Javadoc API documentation.


Test cases are split up over two directories:

src/annotations/tests/classfile/cases/
test/annotations/tests/classfile/cases/

See file test/annotations/tests/classfile/AnnotationsTest.java for
some documentation of the testing framework.

TODO: there are currently two "golden" class files: the un-annoted file
and the expected output after inserting annotations.
Additionally, we could compare:
Unannotated .java --> javac --> .class --> AFU insert into .class --> .class
Unannotated .java --> AFU insert into .java --> javac --> .class
that is, compare the result of inserting the annotations directly
into the bytecode versus inserting into the source code and compiling.
