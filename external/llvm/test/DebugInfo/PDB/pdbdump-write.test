; This testcase checks to make sure that we can write PDB files.  It
; works by first reading a known good PDB file and dumping the contents
; to YAML.  Then it tries to reconstruct as much of the original PDB as
; possible, although depending on what flags are specified when generating
; the YAML, the PDB might be missing data required for any standard tool
; to recognize it.  Finally, it dumps the same set of fields from the newly
; constructed PDB to YAML, and verifies that the YAML is the same as the
; original YAML generated from the good PDB.
