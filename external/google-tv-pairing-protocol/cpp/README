Google TV Pairing Protocol

Overview
--------

The Google TV Pairing Protocol can be used to conduct pairing sessions between
clients and servers on a local network, for example, between a mobile phone and
Google TV. In the pairing process, the client contacts the server, and the
server issues a challenge for the client to complete. This usually involves the
server showing a code of some kind, and the client echoing that code back to the
server. For example, in the case of Google TV, the server might show an
alphanumeric code for the user to enter on the client device's keyboard.
