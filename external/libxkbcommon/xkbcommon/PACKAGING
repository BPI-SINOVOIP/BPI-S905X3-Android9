libxkbcommon consists of two shared libraries, libxkbcommon (the main
library) and libxkbcommon-x11 (an addon library for XCB clients).

The files for libxkbcommon-x11 are:
    libxkbcommon-x11.a libxkbcommon.so* xkbcommon/xkbcommon-x11.h
    xkbcommon-x11.map xkbcommon-x11.pc

libxkbcommon-x11 can be disabled with --disable-x11 (see
`./configure --help` for other options/variables).

Dependencies for libxkbcommon:
- C compiler, autoconf, automake, pkg-config, libc, etc.

- (build optional) xorg-util-macros.
  Output included in tarball.

- (build optional) bison (preferred) or byacc>=20141006.
  Output included in tarball.
  byacc must be configured with --enable-btyacc.

- (build optional, runtime) xkeyboard-config.
  During build, for automatically detecting the value of
  --with-xkb-config-root instead of guessing (/usr/share/X11/xkb).
  During runtime, not strictly needed, but most users of the library
  would need it.

- (runtime) libX11.
  Contains the dataset for Compose support (/usr/share/X11/locale).
  Please don't depend on it explicitly.

- (build optional) doxygen.
  For generating the HTML documentation.

- (build optional) gperf.
  Output included in git and tarball. To regenerate, use
  `make update-keywords`.

Dependencies for libxkbcommon-x11:
- libxkbcommon.

- libxcb>=1.10 with libxcb-xkb.

Dependencies for libxkbcommon-x11 tests:
- xkbcomp, Xvfb.
  If they are not available, the relevant tests are skipped.

Unless libxcb is always available as part of the system, it is preferred
that libxkbcommon and libxkbcommon-x11 be split into separate packages,
such that the main library does not depend on libxcb. This avoids a
transitive dependency of Wayland clients on X libraries.
