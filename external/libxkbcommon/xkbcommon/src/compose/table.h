/*
 * The compose table data structure is a simple trie.  An example will
 * help.  Given these sequences:
 *
 *      <A> <B>        : "first"  dead_a
 *      <A> <C> <D>    : "second" dead_b
 *      <E> <F>        : "third"  dead_c
 *
 * the trie would look like:
 *
 * [root] ---> [<A>] -----------------> [<E>] -#
 *   |           |                        |
 *   #           v                        v
 *             [<B>] ---> [<C>] -#      [<F>] -#
 *               |          |             -
 *               #          v             #
 *                        [<D>] -#
 *                          |
 *                          #
 * where:
 * - [root] is a special empty root node.
 * - [<X>] is a node for a sequence keysym <X>.
 * - right arrows are `next` pointers.
 * - down arrows are `successor` pointers.
 * - # is a nil pointer.
 *
 * The nodes are all kept in a contiguous array.  Pointers are represented
 * as integer offsets into this array.  A nil pointer is represented as 0
 * (which, helpfully, is the offset of the empty root node).
 *
 * Nodes without a successor are leaf nodes.  Since a sequence cannot be a
 * prefix of another, these are exactly the nodes which terminate the
 * sequences (in a bijective manner).
 *
 * A leaf contains the result data of its sequence.  The result keysym is
 * contained in the node struct itself; the result UTF-8 string is a byte
 * offset into an array of the form "\0first\0second\0third" (the initial
 * \0 is so offset 0 points to an empty string).
