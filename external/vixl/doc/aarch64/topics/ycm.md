VIM YouCompleteMe for VIXL
==========================

[YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) is a code completion
engine for VIM. VIXL includes a `.ycm_extra_conf.py` to configure YCM to work in
the VIXL repository.

All you need to do to get things working is to [install YCM](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#full-installation-guide),
preferably with semantic completion for C-family languages.
