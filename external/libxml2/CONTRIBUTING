The current version of the code can be found in the GNOME Git Repository:

    https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/

There's mirror on GitHub:

    https://github.com/GNOME/libxml2

Start discussions and send patches to the mailing list, or file a bug and
add a patch as attachment.

    https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/xml
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=libxml2

Format patches with git-format-patch and use plain text attachments
if possible.

All code must conform to C89 and pass the "make check" tests. Avoid
compiler warnings and add regression tests if possible.

The .travis.yml file can be used to thoroughly check the build with strict
compiler flags, ASan and UBSan. Fork the libxml2 mirror on GitHub and set
up Travis to test the commits you make on your fork.
