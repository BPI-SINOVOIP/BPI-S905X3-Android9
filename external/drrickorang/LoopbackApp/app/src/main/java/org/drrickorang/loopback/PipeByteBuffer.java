     * The ByteBuffer in this class consists of two sections. The first section is the actual pipe
     * to store data. This section must have a size in power of 2, and this is enforced by the
     * constructor through rounding maxSamples up to the nearest power of 2. This second section
     * is used to store metadata. Currently the only metadata is an integer that stores the rear,
     * where rear is the writer's current position. The metadata is at the end of ByteBuffer, and is
     * outside of the actual pipe.
     * IMPORTANT: The code is designed (in native code) such that metadata won't be overwritten when
     * the writer writes to the pipe. If changes to the code are required, please make sure the
     * metadata won't be overwritten.
     * IMPORTANT: Since a signed integer is used to store rear and mFront, their values should not
     * exceed 2^31 - 1, or else overflows happens and the positions of read and mFront becomes
     * incorrect.
