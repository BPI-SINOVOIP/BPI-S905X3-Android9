        Chrome OS on the target closes down most external ports for security.
        We could open the port, but doing that would conflict with security
        tests that check that only expected ports are open.  So, to get to
        the port on the target we use an ssh tunnel.

        This method assumes that xmlrpc and jsonrpc never conflict, since
        we can only either have an xmlrpc or a jsonrpc server listening on
        a remote port. As such, it enforces a single proxy->remote port
        policy, i.e if one starts a jsonrpc proxy/server from port A->B,
        and then tries to start an xmlrpc proxy forwarded to the same port,
        the xmlrpc proxy will override the jsonrpc tunnel process, however:

        1. None of the methods on the xmlrpc proxy will work because
        the server listening on B is jsonrpc.

        2. The xmlrpc client cannot initiate a termination of the JsonRPC
        server, as the only use case currently is goofy, which is tied to
        the factory image. It is much easier to handle a failed xmlrpc
        call on the client than it is to terminate goofy in this scenario,
        as doing the latter might leave the DUT in a hard to recover state.

        With the current implementation newer rpc proxy connections will
        terminate the tunnel processes of older rpc connections tunneling
        to the same remote port. If methods are invoked on the client
        after this has happened they will fail with connection closed errors.
