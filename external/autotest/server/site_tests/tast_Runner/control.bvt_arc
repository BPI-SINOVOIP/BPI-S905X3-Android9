Run the Tast ARC-specific BVT suite.

Tast is an integration-testing framework analagous to the test-running portion
of Autotest. See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/ for
more information.

This test runs Tast-based ARC-specific BVT tests against a remote DUT and
reports failure if any tests (that haven't been marked flaky) fail.
