Run the Tast BVT suite.

Tast is an integration-testing framework analagous to the test-running portion
of Autotest. See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/ for
more information.

This test runs Tast-based BVT tests against a remote DUT and reports failure if
any tests (that haven't been marked flaky) fail.
