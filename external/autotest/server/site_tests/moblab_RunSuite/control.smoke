Kicks off the smoke suite on a Moblab host against the DUTs on its subnet
and ensures the suite completes successfully.

To invole this test locally:
  test_that -b stumpy_moblab <remote> moblab_SmokeSuite --args="<ARGLIST>"

where ARGLIST is a whitespace separated list of the following key=value pairs.
Values pertaining to the test case include:

  boto_path=<boto_path>                path to the boto file to be installed on
                                       the Moblab DUT. If not specified, the
                                       boto file in the current home directory
                                       will be installed if it exists.
  image_storage_server=<server_name>   Google Storage Bucket from which to
                                       fetch test images from. If not
                                       specified, the value will be fetched
                                       from global_config.
  service_init_timeout_m=<int>         Timeout (in minutes) to wait for upstart
                                       services to start on the moblab host.
                                       This can take ~5 minutes on a physical
                                       devices and ~10 minutes on a VM.
  test_timeout_hint_m=<int>            The overall timeout to expect for the
                                       test run. For this test, it is very
                                       important to collect post failure data
                                       from the moblab device. If the overall
                                       timeout is provided, the test will try to
                                       fail early to save some time for log
                                       collection from the DUT.
  clear_devserver_cache=<boolean>      If True, image cache of the devserver
                                       running on moblab is cleared before
                                       running the test to validate devserver
                                       imaging staging flow.
