This test uses /proc/breakme to cause the machine to have various
serious failures (kernel panic, kernel bug, deadlock, etc.), and then
check to make sure that these failures were properly logged and had
appropritate consequences (reboot, logging, etc.).

Pass the kernel crashes as a comma-delimited string of crash types.
