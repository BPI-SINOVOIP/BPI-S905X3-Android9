This test clears the TPM if necessary, kicks off a client side test that enrolls
a device as a hotrod device and hotplugs USB peripherals. After hotplug, it
checks and verifies that both CrOS and Hotrod see the same set of Audio / Video
peripherals. Clears the TPM again before test exits.

Client side part of the test uses telemetry to query for peripherals detected by
the hotrod app.
