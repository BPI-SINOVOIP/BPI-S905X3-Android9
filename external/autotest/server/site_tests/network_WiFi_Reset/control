This test verifies that if a network device can be reset from user space, that
it will connect to the network correctly after being reset a few times. We also
run through a few system suspend/resume cycles in between, for completeness.
Only supports Marvell (mwifiex) at the moment, but will report TestNA for
unsupported devices.
