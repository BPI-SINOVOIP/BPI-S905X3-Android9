This tests autoupdate between two devices via peer to peer.

Use this control file to debug the test at your desk. The test requires the
lab to schedule and provision two DUTs before the test begins. We will need
to do that setup manually before running the test.

Steps:
1. Lock two DUTs in the lab. They need to be the same make/model.
2. Ssh into both and make sure they can ping each other.
3. Provision both DUTs to the same build. You can use provision_AutoUpdate or
   cros flash to do this.
4. Pass two args to test_that: host2, job_repo_url.

test_that <hostname>.cros autoupdate_P2P.local args="host2=<hostname>.cros job_repo_url=<job_repo_url>"
