This test uses servo to connect/disconnect servo USB hub before and
after events like reboot, login, suspend, resume etc.

The test fails if
- device is pingable when suspended
- wrong action passed through action_sequence flag
- USB detected peripherals are different than expected
- there is no servo board attached
- USB peripherals checks(usb_checks below) on command line fail
Other detection checks can be added for each peripheral

Set of USB peripherals plugged
- USB connected printer
