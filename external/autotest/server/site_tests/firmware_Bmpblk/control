This test checks whether the BIOS was built with a correctly configured bmpblk
to ensure crisp firmware screen images and text. The bmpblk for every device
needs to be explicitly configured for the device's screen resolution to ensure
optimal quality. Relies on flashrom and cbfstool to inspect the BIOS image.
