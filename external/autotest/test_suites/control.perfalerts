Run platform_BootPerfServer 100 times across 3 machines for testing boot
performance.
This checks for two things:
1) check that the average time is in range
2) check that if you boot repeatedly, the average time doesn't increase each
boot.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on.  Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
@param SKIP_IMAGE: (optional) If present and True, don't re-image devices.
