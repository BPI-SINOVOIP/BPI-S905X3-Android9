DOC = """
This suite is similar to the au suite except that it's generated during paygen
and does not close the tree when the tests fail. There will be one test per
delta generated by paygen for a given release image. These tests (control
files) are generated at the time we are generating delta payloads, uploaded
by paygen, and expected to be kicked off by paygen. This suite can be re-run
at anytime using atest or the autotest web frontend.

Note: the control files used by this suite are auto-generated and the template
control file is in server/site_tests/autoupdate_EndToEndTest/control.

Note: this suite only tests deltas from the dev channel.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on. Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
