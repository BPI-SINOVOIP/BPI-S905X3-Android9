This suite runs one test, designed to validate the logic the reboots a device
in the case that a GPU hang has caused the UI to crash over and over.

It's in its own suite because that's the only way to run this test in a
per-branch manner.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on. Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
@param SKIP_IMAGE: (optional) If present and True, don't re-image devices.
