This is the portion of the Build Verification Test suite required to
pass on every canary build.  These tests are run against canary
builds only; failures in this suite are evaluated by QA, and
normally will block release.

Requirements for a test to be in this suite:
 1. The test should be SHORT or MEDIUM, and should not require any
    specialized lab resources.
 2. A test failure should indicate that the product is not fit for
    release on any channel.
 3. A test failure should indicate a bug in the product, and not a
    bug in the test.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on. Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
@param SKIP_IMAGE: (optional) If present and True, don't re-image devices.
