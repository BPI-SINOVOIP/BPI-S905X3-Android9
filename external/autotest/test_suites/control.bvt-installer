This suite is used for testing pieces in ChromeOS that would be covered by
the Internals>Installer component (e.g Powerwash). It is run on
the canary and release builders, but not the CQ or PFQ's. These tests are
being split from bvt-inline as their average runtime is not acceptable for
that suite.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: veyron_minnie-release/R60-9575.0.0
@param board: The board to test on. Ex: veyron_minnie
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling.
