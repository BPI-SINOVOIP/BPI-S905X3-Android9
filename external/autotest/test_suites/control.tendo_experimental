Before a test is added to the BVT, it must demonstrate a track
record of stability running in the lab.  The track record is
created by adding it to a suite and allowing it to run.  This suite
groups Tendo related tests for this purpose.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on. Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
