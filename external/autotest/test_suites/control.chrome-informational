This suite contains informational tests that:

* Test Chrome, not Chrome OS
* Require real hardware (for example, to test GPU process init
or display management)
* Should not block uprev of Chrome into Chrome OS

Chrome tests that do not require real hardware should be
implemented in the Chrome repository as unit_tests or browser_tests.

Tests in this suite are usually for experimental projects being
implemented behind a flag. Once the Chrome code stabilizes and
the flag is on-by-default the tests should be moved to bvt-cq
to block Chrome uprev if they fail.

Tests in this suite must be SHORT and should not require any
special lab resources.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: veyron_minnie-release/R60-9575.0.0
@param board: The board to test on. Ex: veyron_minnie
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling.
