This is the usb_detect_stress test suite.

This suite is meant to cover boards on different kernel version
for ARM and non-ARM boards. USB detection tests will be exercizing
USB detect tests during multiple steps.
Consistent failure to detect peripherals will indicate kernel
regression.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on.  Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
@param SKIP_IMAGE: (optional) If present and True, don't re-image devices.
