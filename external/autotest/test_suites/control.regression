The regression suite ensures that we do not drop below a minimum bar of
functionality over time. Tests that belong here include those that may run for
a substantially longer time than the BVT can tolerate, and should exercise
critical pathways that may not be changed in every build but whose
functionality should still be verified regularly.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on. Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
@param SKIP_IMAGE: (optional) If present and True, don't re-image devices.
