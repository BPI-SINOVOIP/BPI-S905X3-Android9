"""Host scheduler.

If run as a standalone service, the host scheduler ensures the following:
    1. Hosts will not be assigned to multiple hqes simultaneously. The process
       of assignment in this case refers to the modification of the host_id
       column of a row in the afe_host_queue_entries table, to reflect the host
       id of a leased host matching the dependencies of the job.
    2. Hosts that are not being used by active hqes or incomplete special tasks
       will be released back to the available hosts pool, for acquisition by
       subsequent hqes.
In addition to these guarantees, the host scheduler also confirms that no 2
active hqes/special tasks are assigned the same host, and sets the leased bit
for hosts needed by frontend special tasks. The need for the latter is only
apparent when viewed in the context of the job-scheduler (monitor_db), which
runs special tasks only after their hosts have been leased.

** Suport minimum duts requirement for suites (non-inline mode) **

Each suite can specify the minimum number of duts it requires by
dropping a 'suite_min_duts' job keyval which defaults to 0.

When suites are competing for duts, if any suite has not got minimum duts
it requires, the host scheduler will try to meet the requirement first,
even if other suite may have higher priority or earlier timestamp. Once
all suites' minimum duts requirement have been fullfilled, the host
scheduler will allocate the rest of duts based on job priority and suite job id.
This is to prevent low priority suites from starving when sharing pool with
high-priority suites.

Note:
    1. Prevent potential starvation:
       We need to carefully choose |suite_min_duts| for both low and high
       priority suites. If a high priority suite didn't specify it but a low
       priority one does, the high priority suite can be starved!
    2. Restart requirement:
       Restart host scheduler if you manually released a host by setting
       leased=0 in db. This is needed because host scheduler maintains internal
       state of host assignment for suites.
    3. Exchanging duts triggers provisioning:
       TODO(fdeng): There is a chance two suites can exchange duts,
       if the two suites are for different builds, the exchange
       will trigger provisioning. This can be optimized by preferring getting
       hosts with the same build.
