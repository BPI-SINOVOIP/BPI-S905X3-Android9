ISIC -- IP Stack Integrity Checker

Description:
ISIC is a suite of utilities to exercise the stability of an IP Stack and its
component stacks (TCP, UDP, ICMP et. al.) It generates piles of pseudo random
packets of the target protocol. The packets be given tendancies to conform to.
Ie 50% of the packets generated can have IP Options. 25% of the packets can
be IP fragments... But the percentages are arbitrary and most of the packet
fields have a configurable tendancy.

The packets are then sent against the target machine to either penetrate its
firewall rules or find bugs in the IP stack.

ISIC also contains a utility generate raw ether frames to examine hardware
implementations.

Other Uses:
Other novel uses people have found for ISIC include IDS testing, stack
fingerprinting, breaking sniffers and barraging the IRC kiddie.


Warning:
ISIC may break shit, melt your network, knock out your
firewall, or singe the fur off your cat


usage: isic [-v] [-D] -s <source ip> -d <destination ip>
       [-p <pkts to generate>] [-k <skip packets>] [-x <send packet X times>]
        [-r <random seed>] [-m <max kB/s to generate>]
        Percentage Opts: [-F frags] [-V <Bad IP Version>]
                         [-I <Random IP Header length>]
notes:
        [-D] causes packet info to be printed out -- DEBUGGING

       ex: -s a.b.c.d   -d a.b.c.d -F100
        100% of the packets will be ^^^^ fragments
       ex: -s a.b.c.d   -d a.b.c.d -p 100 -r 103334
       ex: -s rand   -d rand -r 23342
              ^^^^ causes random source addr
       ex: -s rand   -d rand -k 10000 -p 10001 -r 666
               Will only send the 10001 packet with random seed 666
               this is especially useful if you suspect that packet is
               causing a problem with the target stack.
