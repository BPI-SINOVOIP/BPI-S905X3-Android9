Runs the crashme suite located at:

All the files purporting to be source, available for download on this
site, appear to be corrupted.

I got the sources here:

https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/natty/+source/crashme/2.4-9

crashme_2.4.orig.tar.gz
crashme_2.4-9.diff.gz

The 'makefile' must be modified to replace 'cc' with '$(CC)' so that
32-bit executables will be produced.
