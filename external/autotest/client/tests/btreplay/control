Here's a test that takes a trace produced by blktrace, and uses btreplay
to replay it against a device. Output consists of wall clock time,
system time, and average request completion latency.

A spare device or partition is required for the test to trash. If this
is unacceptable, it can easily be changed to be read-only by default.

The trick, of course, will be choosing one or more traces that are
generally "interesting enough" to include.
