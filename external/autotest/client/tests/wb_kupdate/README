Description:
------------
This tests checks the wb_kupdate code path by writting data to a sparse file
mounted on a loop back device formated with a user specified filesystem,
and waiting a maximum of 'max_flush_time' for writeback to flush the dirty
datat from the cache to disk.

At the end of the test a keyval is generated which states per iteration the time
taken to write the user specified amount of data to disk.
