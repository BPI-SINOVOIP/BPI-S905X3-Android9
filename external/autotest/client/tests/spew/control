The spew package is used to test I/O performance and to generate load
on character devices, block devices, and file systems.  It is similar
to the lmdd program found in the lmbench test-suite
(http://www.bitmover.com/lmbench). It is a bit easier to use than lmdd
and has some added functionality.  For example, it can test both
random and sequential I/O.
