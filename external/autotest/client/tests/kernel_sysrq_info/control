Verifies select /proc/sysrq-trigger commands.

Fail if any "show-*" SysRq command doesn't match the regexp in the
test case, or if it crashes the system:
  - show-backtrace-all-active-cpus(L)
  - show-memory-usage(M)
  - show-registers(P)
  - show-all-timers(Q)
  - show-task-states(T)
  - show-blocked-tasks(W)

These SysRq commands are used to gather postmortem data from systems
deployed in the field, so it is critical that they work correctly (and
don't crash the system).
