Make sure build process dumps config errors in separate file from build
errors (and warnings), from build output

Fix lmbench's config stage stuff

Redirect stdout and stderr for each test's setup and execute to 4 sep files
  (APW: ok, not clear i really like them (out/err) being separated.
   the loss of chronology is bad IMHO)
  (MJB: I was thinking of kernel compiles I guess. Maybe we should just
	do it for that, and make the rest more generic)

Caching version of kernelexpand to grab new kernels

Errors from profilers are not being caught (shove a syntax error in a profiler
python script to see what I mean) ... generates a file in results/debug/debug,
but doesn't cascade up
