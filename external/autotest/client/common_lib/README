======

This directory is the holding area for storing libraries which are common
to both client and server. Libraries which are client-specific should live
in client/bin and libraries which are server-specific should live in
server.

This directory is a sub-directory of client because AutoTest doesn't install 
anything but the client directory.

Libraries in this directory should only rely on other libraries in this
directory. In other words, they should not reach out in client/bin or server.
