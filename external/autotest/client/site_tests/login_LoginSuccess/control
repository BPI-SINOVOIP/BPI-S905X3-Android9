This test verifies that signing in via the UI (using Telemetry) works correctly.
This includes listening to DBus to verify that the session_manager announces the
start of a user session upon sign in, as well as the end of one on sign out.

This test can also be used as a 'helper test' to sign into a system
using Telemetry. To this end, it sets client_success to True on
success so callers can verify it ran correctly.
