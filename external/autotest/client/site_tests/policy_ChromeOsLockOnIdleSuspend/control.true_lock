Verify effects of ChromeOsLockOnIdleSuspend policy.

This test case verifies the behavior and appearance of Chrome OS when the
ChromeOsLockOnIdleSuspend user policy is set True.

The test case shall pass if the 'Require password to wake from sleep' check
box is checked and uneditable, and the Screen Lock is displayed when the
device goes to sleep. It shall fail if this behavior is not enforced.
