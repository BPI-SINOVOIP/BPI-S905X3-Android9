Verify effects of ChromeOsLockOnIdleSuspend policy.

This test case verifies the behavior and appearance of Chrome OS when the
ChromeOsLockOnIdleSuspend user policy is Not set.

The test case shall pass if the 'Require password to wake from sleep' check
box is user editable, and the Screen Lock is not displayed when the device
goes to sleep. It shall fail if this behavior is not enforced.
