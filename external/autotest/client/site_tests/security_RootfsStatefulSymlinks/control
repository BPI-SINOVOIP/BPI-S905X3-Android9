Locating important system files outside of the integrity-controlled
rootfs can undermine the security provided by verified boot. Therefore,
there should be a whitelisted, limited, reviewed set of locations where
we symlink from inside the rootfs out to the stateful partition. This
test enforces that.

The test succeeds if all links pointing into "bad destinations" are
