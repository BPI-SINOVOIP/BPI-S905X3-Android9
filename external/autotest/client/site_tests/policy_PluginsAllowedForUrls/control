Verify effect of PluginsAllowedForUrls policy on Chrome OS behavior.

This test verifies the effect of the PluginsAllowedForUrls user policy on
Chrome OS client behavior, when DefaultPluginsSetting=2 (Block Plugins). It
exercises all valid policy values across three test cases:
SiteAllowed_Run, SiteNotAllowed_Block, and NotSet_Block.

This default control file allows CloudDPC E2E tests to run any test case
defined in this test via command-line.
