This test measures the battery charging time and enforces constraints. Before
running this test, the battery charge should be less than 5% and the device
should be plugged into AC. Also, the battery capacity at test time must be
at least 80% of design capacity (battery wear can be 20% at most). Over the
course of 3 hours, the battery charge should  increase by at least 94% of the
maximum battery charge.
