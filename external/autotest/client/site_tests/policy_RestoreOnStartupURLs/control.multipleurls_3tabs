Verify effects of RestoreOnStartupURLs policy on client behavior & appearance.

This test case verifies the behavior and appearance of Chrome OS when the
RestoreOnStartupURLs user policy specifies multiple URLs.

The test case shall pass when one browser tab is opened only for each of the
URLs specified in the policy value, and in the order specified (left to
right). It shall fail if the above behavior is not enforced.
