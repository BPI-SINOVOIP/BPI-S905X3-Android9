Verify effects of PowerManagementIdleSettings policy on client behavior.

This test case verifies the behavior and appearance of Chrome OS when the
PowerManagementIdleSettings user policy IdleAction is not set.

The test shall pass if the user session continues (i.e., is not logged out,
and does not go to sleep) after the Delay:Idle time expires. It shall fail if
this behavior is not enforced.
