Verify effects of PowerManagementIdleSettings policy on client behavior.

This test case verifies the behavior and appearance of Chrome OS when the
PowerManagementIdleSettings user policy IdleAction is not set.

The test shall pass if the user session sleeps (i.e., screen blanks, but user
is not logged out) after the Delay:Idle time expires. It shall fail if this
behavior is not enforced.
