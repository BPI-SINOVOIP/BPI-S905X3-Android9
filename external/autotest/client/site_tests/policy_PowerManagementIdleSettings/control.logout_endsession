Verify effects of PowerManagementIdleSettings policy on client behavior.

This test case verifies the behavior and appearance of Chrome OS when the
PowerManagementIdleSettings user policy IdleAction is not set.

The test shall pass if the user session ends (i.e., is logged out) after the
Delay:Idle time expires. It shall fail if this behavior is not enforced.
