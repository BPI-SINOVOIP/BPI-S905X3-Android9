Verify effects of EditBookmarksEnabled policy on client behavior & appearance.

This test case verifies the behavior and appearance of Chrome OS when the
EditBookmarksEnabled user policy is not set.

The test case shall pass if the Manage Bookmarks page allows the user to add a
new bookmark. It shall fail if that behavior is not enforced.
