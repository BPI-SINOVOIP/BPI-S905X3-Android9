  Tests that we can negotiate a lease on an IPv4 address via DHCP,
  but apply Static IP parameters instead.

  This test succceeds if dhcpcd is able to negotiate and DHCP lease, but then
  apply static IP parameters and release the lease after acquiring DNS and
  other parameters.  This test further ensures that during static IP
  negotiation although a lease is negotiated, it is released back to the DHCP
  server.  When static IP configuration is removed another negotiation should
  go back to using the server-provided IP address.
