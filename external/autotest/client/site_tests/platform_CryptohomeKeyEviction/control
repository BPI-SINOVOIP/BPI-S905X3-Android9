    Ensure that the cryptohome properly manages key eviction from
    the tpm. This test verifies this behaviour by creating 30 keys using
    chaps, and then remounting a user's cryptohome. Mount requires use of the
    user's cryptohome key, and thus the mount only succeeds if the
    cryptohome key was properly evicted and reloaded into the TPM.
