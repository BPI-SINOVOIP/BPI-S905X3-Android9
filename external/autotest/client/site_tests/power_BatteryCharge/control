This test enforces the following contraints:
 - Initial battery charge < 5%
 - Device should be plugged in to an AC outlet
 - In 4 hours, the battery charge should increase by at least 94% of maximum

This test depends on power_status.py, which is included in
client/cros/ in AutoTest. power_status.py has many status
initialization and parsing routines for battery status.
