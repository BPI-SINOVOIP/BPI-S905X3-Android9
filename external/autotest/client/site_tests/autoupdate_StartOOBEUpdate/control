This test will start a forced autoupdate at OOBE.
It will create a custom lsb-release file listing the devserver that we will
use for the update. Then move through OOBE to the update screen. Once the
update starts, the test will return.

This test will be used with the companion server side test
autoupdate_ForcedOOBEUpdate. The server side test will be responsible for
starting this test and deciding on the final result.
