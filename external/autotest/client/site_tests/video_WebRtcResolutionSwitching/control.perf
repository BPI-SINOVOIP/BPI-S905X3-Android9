DOC = """
This test starts 5 loopback peer connections, each with 4 streams with
different resolutions. The test then switches randomly which of the streams are
active for each connection, effectively flipping between different resolutions.

The tests use a fake media stream - not a real camera.

The test collects system metrics during the run. See go/cfm-perf-metrics
for details about the metrics.
