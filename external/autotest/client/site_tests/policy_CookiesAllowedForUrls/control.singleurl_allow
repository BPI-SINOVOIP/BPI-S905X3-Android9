Verify effects of CookiesAllowedForUrls policy.

This test case verifies the behavior of Chrome OS when CookiesAllowedForUrls
user policy is set to a single URL pattern, and DefaultCookiesSetting policy
is set to 2 (do not allow by default).

The test case shall pass iff the browser allows cookies for any test page with
an URL that matches any of the URL patterns specified in CookiesAllowedForUrls,
and blocks cookies on any page with an URL that does not match. It shall fail
if the browser does not enforce this behavior.
