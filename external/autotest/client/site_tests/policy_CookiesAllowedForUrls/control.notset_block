Verify effects of CookiesAllowedForUrls policy.

This test case verifies the behavior of Chrome OS when CookiesAllowedForUrls
user policy is not set to any URL pattern, and DefaultCookiesSetting policy
is set to 2 (do not allow by default).

The test case shall pass iff the browser blocks cookies for every test page.
It shall fail if the browser allows cookies on any test page.
