This test runs a WebRTC getUserMedia call and assigns the camera stream to
one video tag. This test will fail if any of these steps fail on the
javascript level; it does not check if the frames we receive are actually
sane. Furthermore, this test uses fake devices and not the real webcam.
Frames and real webcams are checked by the video_WebRtcCamera test though.
