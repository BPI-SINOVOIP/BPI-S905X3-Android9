Verify effects of URLWhitelist policy.

This test case verifies the behavior of Chrome OS when URLWhitelist
user policy is set to a single URL pattern.

A test case shall pass iff only URLs that are in the URLWhitelist policy value
are allowed, and all other URLs are blocked. The test case shall fail if the
above behavior is not enforced.
