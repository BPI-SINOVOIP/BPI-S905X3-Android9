Verify effects of URLBlacklist policy.

This test case verifies the behavior of Chrome OS when URLBlacklist
user policy is set to a single URL pattern.

A test case shall pass iff URLs that are in the URLBlacklist policy value
are blocked, and all other URLs are allowed. The test case shall fail if the
above behavior is not enforced.
