Verify effects of policy_URLBlacklist policy on client behavior.

This test verifies the effect of the URLBlacklist user policy on Chrome OS
client behavior. It exercises a range of policy values using three unique test
cases, named: NotSet_Allowed, SinglePage_Blocked and MultiplePages_Blocked.
See the test file for a full description of what each test case does.

A test case shall pass if:
 - Only URLs that are in the URLBlacklist policy value are blocked.
 - All other URLs are allowed.
The test case shall fail if the above behavior is not enforced.
