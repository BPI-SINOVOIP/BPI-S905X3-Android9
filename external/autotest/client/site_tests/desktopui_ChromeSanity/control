Test that Chrome is at least marginally usable.

Uses Telemetry to log in, load a simple HTML page, and log out. Along the way,
tests that session_manager emits the expected SessionStateChanged D-Bus signal
about the session starting and that the user's encrypted home directory is
mounted.

A failure can indicate several things:

- Telemetry-to-Chrome communication isn't working (is Chrome crashing?).
- Chrome and session_manager aren't coordinating login properly.
- Chrome is internally broken and can't load web pages.
- Chrome and cryptohome aren't coordinating user home dir mounting properly.

That's a fairly broad range of causes. They're all covered here with the intent
of providing a single fast-running, minimally-flaky test that can be used to
validate new versions of Chrome before integrating them into Chrome OS.

The info log provides high-level information about what the test is doing and
can hopefully be used to narrow down the location of failure.
