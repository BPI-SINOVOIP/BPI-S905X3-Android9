Set baseline expectations for hosting Chrome OS VM images. In the Chrome OS lab
these are based on current Google Compute Engine (GCE) server offerings and
represent the lowest common denominator to effectively run QEMU/kvm. As a
result VMs can be thought of as a slightly outdated Intel Chromebox. GCE is not
the only host environment, and it runs in a VM as well. We attempt to control
this environment as well as possible. This test ensures relevant changes are
detected over time.
