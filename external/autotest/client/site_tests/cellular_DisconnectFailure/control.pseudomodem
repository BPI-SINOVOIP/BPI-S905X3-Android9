PURPOSE = """
Tests that a disconnect failure at the modemmanager level is handled properly
by shill.

"""
CRITERIA = """
The test will fail if the cellular service exposed by shill is in an
incorrect state upon certain failures of a Disconnect call.

DOC = """
The test uses the pseudo modem manager to simulate two failure scenarios of a
Disconnect call: failure while the modem state is DISCONNECTING and failure
while it is CONNECTED. The expected behavior of shill is to do nothing if the
modem state is DISCONNECTING and to clean up the service otherwise.
