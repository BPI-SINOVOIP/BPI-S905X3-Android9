Run this test to collect golden images for a certain device and  build. This
test will use an VP8 720p video to produce the images.

This test is not intended to be run automatically in the lab. Instead it
should be scheduled to run on a desired dut via autotest.

Golden images can then be copied from the dut once the test is finished.
