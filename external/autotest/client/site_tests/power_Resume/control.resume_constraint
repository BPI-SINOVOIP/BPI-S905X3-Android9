This test will search /var/log/messages for pertinent strings to determine if
the cpu is sleeping. It will wait for a number of seconds before suspending to
ram. It will then calculate how many seconds the system was suspended, and
how many seconds it took to resume. As a precaution it will ensure your
network interface is UP after it has resumed.
