  Tests that shill can renew leases through dhcpcd.  In particular,
  this test replies to a DHCPREQUEST method with a subset of the
  DHCP parameters it sent in the original DHCPOFFER, and observe
  whether the client can retain those options itself.

  This test fails if shill fails to renew the lease, or if the
  parameters in the resulting ifconfig do not retain the values from
  the DHCPOFFER.
