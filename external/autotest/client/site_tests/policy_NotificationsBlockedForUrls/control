Verify effect of NotificationsBlockedForUrls policy on Chrome OS behavior.

This test verifies the effect of the NotificationsBlockedForUrls user policy on
Chrome OS client behavior, when DefaultNotificationSetting=1 (i.e., allow
notifications). It exercises all valid policy values across three test cases:
SiteBlocked_Block, SiteAllowed_Show, and NotSet_Show.

This default control file allows CloudDPC E2E tests to run any test case
defined in this test via command-line.
