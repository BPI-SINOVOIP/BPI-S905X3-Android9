This test exercises the logic we put in place to reboot the device in the
face of a too-crashy UI:

If the UI crashes too much too fast, the device will eventually reboot
to attempt to mitigate the problem. If the device determines that it's
already tried that some number of times, it will shut down the UI and
remain up.

This test will crash the browser repeatedly and, in the case that it
has not rebooted before, the test will cause the device to reboot. If
it has rebooted within a certain window of time, the test will expect
the device to stay up.

This test cannot be used on its own, but is intended to be used in
conjunction with the server-side desktopui_CrashyRebootServer test.
