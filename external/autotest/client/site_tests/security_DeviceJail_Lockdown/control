This test is not applicable if the control devices for device jail are
not present. This means the kernel must be 3.14 or later.
The test will fail if it can perform a privileged operation on a jail
device which has been locked down. For example, trying to detach the
kernel driver or talk directly to a driver for a USB device should
not be allowed on these devices.
