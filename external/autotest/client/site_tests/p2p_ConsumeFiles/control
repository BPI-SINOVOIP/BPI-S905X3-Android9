This test runs p2p-client on several common cases using a fake network of peers
to check that it can discover files on this network. If p2p-client isn't able
to discover and return URLs in this environment the test will fail. Among the
tested scenarios, a case where p2p-client should hang (because there are too
many connections) is included.
