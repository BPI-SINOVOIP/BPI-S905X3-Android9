  - compressed swap is not configured.
  - oom events occur before swap space is mostly consumed.

Verify compressed swap is configured and basically works.

The resources being verified are:

MemTotal
MemFree
SwapTotal
SwapFree

Memory hogs are started to allocate and touch pages to consume free memory.
As free memory approaches 0, swap space starts to be used.
Verify we can consume most of swap without hitting any oom conditions.
Verify we get low memory notification.
Verify low memory notification goes away after some memory is freed.
