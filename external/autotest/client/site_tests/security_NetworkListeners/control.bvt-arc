# Ordinarily, a test shouldn't be in both bvt-inline and bvt-arc since
# that will make it run twice in release builders.  However, the CQ
# doesn't run bvt-arc on all board families, and not all Android PFQ
# builders run bvt-inline.  We need this test in both of those contexts.
#
# We could solve this by running bvt-arc on all ARC families in the CQ just
# for the sake of this one test, but that seems harder to explain.  The
# cost of running twice in release builders is low enough, so that's
# what we're doing.
