This test verifies that our UI respawning logic functions correctly under
normal conditions. That is, that the UI will cease restarting after a certain
number of failed respawn attempts. By design, this test does _not_ attempt to
ensure that these values remain the same over time. The values are
somewhat arbitrary anyhow, so enforcing them is simply an over-constraint.
