Verify effects of ImagesBlockedForUrls policy.

This test case verifies the behavior of Chrome OS when ImagesBlockedForUrls
user policy is set to a single URL pattern, and DefaultImagesSetting policy
is set to 1 or undefined (allow by default).

The test case shall pass iff the browser blocks images for any test page with
an URL that matches any of the URL patterns specified in ImagesBlockedForUrls,
and allows images on any page with an URL that does not match. It shall fail
if the browser does not enforce this behavior.
