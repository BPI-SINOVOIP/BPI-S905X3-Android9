Verify effects of ImagesBlockedForUrls policy.

This test case verifies the behavior of Chrome OS when ImagesBlockedForUrls
user policy is not set to any URL pattern, and DefaultImagesSetting policy
is set to 1 or undefined (allow by default).

The test case shall pass iff the browser allows images for every test page.
It shall fail if the browser blocks images on any test page.
