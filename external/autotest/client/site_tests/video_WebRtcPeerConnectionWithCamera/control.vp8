DOC = """
This test starts a loopback WebRTC call with two peer connections
and ensures it successfully establishes the call (otherwise the test
will simply fail). If successful, it looks at the video frames coming
out on the receiving side of the call and looks for freezes and black
frames. If this test shows black frames and video_WebRtcCamera does not,
it could mean video isn't encoded/decoded right on this device but that
the camera works. Finally, input and output FPS are logged.

Black frames/freezes/fps are reported to the perf dashboard and
must be monitored there.
