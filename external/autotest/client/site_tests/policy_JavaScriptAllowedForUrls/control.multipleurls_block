Verify effects of JavaScriptAllowedForUrls policy.

This test case verifies the behavior of Chrome OS when JavaScriptAllowedForUrls
user policy is set to multiple URL patterns, and DefaultJavaScriptSetting policy
is set to 2 (do not allow by default).

A test case shall pass if the browser allows JavaScript to execute only
on a test page with a URL that matches one or more of the URL patterns listed
in JavaScriptAllowedForUrls. A test shall fail if the browser blocks execution
on a page where it should be allowed, or allows execution on a page where it
should be blocked.
