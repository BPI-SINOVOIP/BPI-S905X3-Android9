This test is used to pull the network cable from the DUTs and ensure that
update_engine is able to continue with the update after it is done.

The length of time the test waits can be configured by passing in a
time_without_network=X variable. X is defined in seconds.

This test will not be run standalone. It will be kicked off from a server
