Test the SIM locking functionality of shill.

This test has the following test_cases:
  - Attempt to enable SIM lock with incorrect sim-pin. Verify that the
    attempt fails.
  - Successfully pin-lock the SIM.
  - Unlock a pin-locked SIM.
  - Attempt to unlock a pin-locked SIM with incorrect sim-pin, until it gets
    puk-locked.
  - Unblock a puk-locked SIM.
  - Attempt to unblock a puk-locked SIM with incorrect sim-puk, until the SIM
    gets blocked. At this point, a sim-pin2 might be expected by some SIMs. This
    test does not attempt to unlock the SIM using sim-pin2.
  - Test the functionality to change sim-pin.
