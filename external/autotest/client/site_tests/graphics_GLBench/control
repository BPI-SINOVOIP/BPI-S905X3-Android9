CRITERIA = """
Test should not crash and not overheat (which is monitored by PerfControl).
Test generates output images and verifies their bit accuracy using MD5 checksums
which are stored in
../../deps/glbench/glbench_reference_images.txt (for known good images)
and in ../../deps/glbench/glbench_knownbad_images.txt (for ignored failures -
this should be very rare though).

If unknown images are encountered the test fails. To resolve this use an
image diffing tool like Beyond Compare and visually check differences between
the unknown image and older versions in ../../deps/glbench-images/.
Note: it should nearly never be required to remove old versions of good/bad
images from these directories.

This benchmark executes glbench, a graphics benchmark designed to time how long
various graphic intensive activities take, which includes measuring:
  - fill rate
    - blended
    - opaque
  -Z reject rate
  -triangle rate
    - no cull
    - half cull (half triangles backface culled)
    - full cull (mix of back face and degenerates)
  - blend rate
  - texture fetch
    - nearest
    - bilinear
    - trilinear
  - compute
    - vertex shader
    - pixel shader
    - *fragement shader to test ddx and ddy
  - attribute fetch
  - color depth stencil test
  - *state change
  - texture upload
  - read back

* Not yet implemented.
