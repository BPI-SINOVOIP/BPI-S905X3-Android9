DOC = """
This test makes WebRTC GetUserMedia call and renders the camera's media
stream in a video tag. It uses the real webcam on the device.

This test will test VGA and 720p (if supported by the device) and check
if the gUM call succeeds.

The test also logs the number of black frames and frozen frames to perf
(there should not be many such frames). Those performance statistics
should be monitored in the perf dashboard; many frozen or black frames
mean that the gUM call succeeded, but the CrOS device fails to deliver
sane video frames.
