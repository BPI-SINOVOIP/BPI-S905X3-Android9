Verify effects of CookiesSessionOnlyForUrls policy.

This test case verifies the behavior and appearance of Chrome OS when the user
policy CookiesSessionOnlyForUrls contains a pattern that matches the URL of a
visited page, and DefaultCookiesSetting=2 (ie, block cookies by default).

The test case shall pass if the browser allows cookie storage for the test
page, because the page URL matches one of the URL patterns specified in
CookiesSessionOnlyForUrls. It shall fail if the browser blocks cookie storage
for the test page.
