    Tests here are focused on errata that are quick to check for.  This
    test can also fail if we don't detect the needed kernel infrastructure

    This test will look at /proc/cpuinfo and determine if we're on a CPU
    with known errata.  It will then attempt to confirm (perhaps by using
    /sys/kernel/debug/arm_coprocessor_debug) that the errata fixes are present.

    If we detect that we're not on an ARM board or if we're running on an ARM
    core that we know of no errata for, this test will pass.
