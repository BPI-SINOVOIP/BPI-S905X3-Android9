    Checks that there is a TPM, that the driver can talk to it, and that the
    TCS daemon can talk to the driver.  Assumes that the firmware has started
    the TPM, but makes no other assumptions on the TPM state (activated or not,
    owned or not, etc.)

    Also checks that the driver contains an important patch (gentle shutdown).
