Verify effects of JavaScriptBlockedForUrls policy.

This test case verifies the behavior of Chrome OS when JavaScriptBlockedForUrls
user policy is not set to any URL pattern, and the DefaultJavaScriptSetting
policy is set to 1 (allow by default).

The test case shall pass iff the browser allows javascript for every test page.
It shall fail if the browser blocks javascript on any test page.
