This test will fail if the URL fails to load or the test does not complete

DOC = """
This test opens a new browser to the internal Gmail latency test URL and
waits for the test to complete.
TODO(sosa@chromium.org) - Must find way to bring over tests from image (add
to chromium buildbot, etc).  url_fetch_test is from ~chromium/src/chrome/test
TODO(sjg@chromium.org) - Create an externally-accessible URL for use by this
test. At present the test can only be run by one dev, and is intended for use
by the Gmail team.
TODO(sjg@chromium.org) - Move this to use PyAuto or some other mechanism
which uses the running Chrome and doesn't involve us including a binary with
this test
