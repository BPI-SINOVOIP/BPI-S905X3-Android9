Verify effects of ImagesAllowedForUrls policy.

This test case verifies the behavior of Chrome OS when ImagesAllowedForUrls
user policy is not set to any URL pattern, and DefaultImagesSetting policy
is set to 2 (do not allow by default).

The test case shall pass iff the browser blocks images for every test page.
It shall fail if the browser allows images on any test page.
