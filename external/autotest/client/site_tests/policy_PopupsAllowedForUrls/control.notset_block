Verify effects of PopupsAllowedForUrls policy.

This test case verifies the behavior of Chrome OS when PopupsAllowedForUrls
user policy is not set to any URL pattern, and DefaultPopupsSetting policy
is set to 2 (do not allow by default).

The test case shall pass iff the browser blocks popups for every test page.
It shall fail if the browser allows popups on any test page.
