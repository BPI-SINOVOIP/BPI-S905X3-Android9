touch_TabSwitch test uses two gesture files that scroll. All scrolls
recorded should be unaccelerated and done in a single motion (i.e. do not
lift fingers and continue to scroll). Having the scroll stop in the middle of
the test would break the test. The gesture files for each device recorded are:

<DEVICE NAME>_touchpad_Touch ID_three-finger-swipe-left  - Three finger scroll on touchpad to switch to another tab in left direction.
<DEVICE NAME>_touchpad_Touch ID_three-finger-swipe-right  - Three finger scroll on touchpad to switch to another tab in right direction.
