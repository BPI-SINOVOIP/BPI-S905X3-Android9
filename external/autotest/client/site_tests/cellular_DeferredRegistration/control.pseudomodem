This test will fail if one of the following conditions occurs:

  Tests that shill can handle temporary registration loss without destroying
  the service because some modems periodically go searching for a better signal
  while still connected to the network.  Additionally, make sure that shill
  still destroys a service that has suffered a registration loss for an
  extended period of time (>15s).
