DOC = """
This test starts 5 high resolution loopback peer connections. Four of the video
elements are styled to be small, thumbnail sized and one is in its native size.
This is intended to simulate a video conference with one main feed and several
smaller feeds.

The test then frequently swaps the sourceObject of the main feed with a
randomly chosen smaller feed.

The tests use a fake media stream - not a real camera.
