This test starts 5 high resolution (1280x720) loopback peer connections. Four
of the video elements are styled to be small, thumbnail sized (182x136) and one
is in its native size.  This is intended to simulate a video conference with
one main feed and several smaller feeds.

The test then frequently swaps the sourceObject of the main feed with a
randomly chosen smaller feed.

The tests use a fake media stream - not a real camera.

The test collects system metrics during the run. See go/cfm-perf-metrics
for details about the metrics.
