Verify effects of CookiesBlockedForUrls policy.

This test case verifies the behavior of Chrome OS when CookiesBlockedForUrls
user policy is not set to any URL pattern, and DefaultCookiesSetting policy
is set to 1 (allow by default).

The test case shall pass iff the browser allows cookies for every test page.
It shall fail if the browser blocks cookies on any test page.
