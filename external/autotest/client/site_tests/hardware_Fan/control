This is a hardware test for system fan.  The test first sets the fan to max
speed, turns off the fan, and then sets to 50% speed.  The test sleeps for a
few seconds after setting the fan speed, which allows the fan some time to
spin up/down and ensures the correctness of the test.  The test restores fan
setting when finished.  This test uses mosys to read and control fan settings.
