# http://www.appveyor.com/docs/appveyor-yml
#
# To setup AppVeyor for your own personal repositories do the following:
# - Sign up
# - Add a new project
# - Select Git and fill in the Git clone URL
# - Setup a Git hook as explained in
#   https://github.com/appveyor/webhooks#installing-git-hook
# - Check 'Settings > General > Skip branches without appveyor.yml'
# - Check 'Settings > General > Rolling builds'
# - Setup the global or project notifications to your liking
#
# Note that kicking (or restarting) a build via the web UI will not work, as it
# will fail to find appveyor.yml .  The Git hook is the most practical way to
# kick a build.

# Don't download the full Mesa history to speed up cloning.  However the clone
# depth must not be too small, otherwise builds might fail when lots of patches
# are committed in succession, because the desired commit is not found on the

# It's possible to setup notification here, as described in
# http://www.appveyor.com/docs/notifications#appveyor-yml-configuration , but
# doing so would cause the notification settings to be replicated across all
# repos, which is most likely undesired.  So it's better to rely on the
# Appveyor global/project notification settings.
