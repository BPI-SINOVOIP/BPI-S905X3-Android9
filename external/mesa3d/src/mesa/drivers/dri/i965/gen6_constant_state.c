 * Creates a streamed BO containing the push constants for the VS or GS on

 *
 * Push constants are constant values (such as GLSL uniforms) that are
 * pre-loaded into a shader stage's register space at thread spawn time.
 *
 * Not all GLSL uniforms will be uploaded as push constants: The hardware has
 * a limitation of 32 or 64 EU registers (256 or 512 floats) per stage to be
 * uploaded as push constants, while GL 4.4 requires at least 1024 components
 * to be usable for the VS.  Plus, currently we always use pull constants
 * instead of push constants when doing variable-index array access.
 *
 * See brw_curbe.c for the equivalent gen4/5 code.
