/**
 * Enum for keeping track of the fast clear state of a buffer associated with

 *
 * Fast clear works by deferring the memory writes that would be used to clear
 * the buffer, so that instead of performing them at the time of the clear
 * operation, the hardware automatically performs them at the time that the
 * buffer is later accessed for rendering.  The MCS buffer keeps track of
 * which regions of the buffer still have pending clear writes.
 *
 * This enum keeps track of the driver's knowledge of pending fast clears in
 * the MCS buffer.
 *
 * MCS buffers only exist on Gen7+.

/**
 * \brief Map of miptree slices to needed resolves.
 *
 * The map is implemented as a linear doubly-linked list.
 *
 * In the intel_resolve_map*() functions, the \c head argument is not
 * inspected for its data. It only serves as an anchor for the list.
 *
 * \par Design Discussion
 *
 *     There are two possible ways to record which miptree slices need
 *     resolves. 1) Maintain a flag for every miptree slice in the texture,
 *     likely in intel_mipmap_level::slice, or 2) maintain a list of only
 *     those slices that need a resolve.
 *
 *     Immediately before drawing, a full depth resolve performed on each
 *     enabled depth texture. If design 1 were chosen, then at each draw call
 *     it would be necessary to iterate over each miptree slice of each
 *     enabled depth texture in order to query if each slice needed a resolve.
 *     In the worst case, this would require 2^16 iterations: 16 texture
 *     units, 16 miplevels, and 256 depth layers (assuming maximums for OpenGL
 *     2.1).
 *
 *     By choosing design 2, the number of iterations is exactly the minimum
 *     necessary.
