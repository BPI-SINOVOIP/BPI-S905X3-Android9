INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

To build and install the libfec libraries, simply say

./configure
make
make test (optional)
make install (as root)

By default, "make install" puts the libfec libraries in
/usr/local/lib, the include files in /usr/local/include, and the
manual page in /usr/local/man.

You may have an old version of the GNU assembler that cannot handle
the relatively new SSE2 mnemonics. Update your version of the GNU
"binutils" package.

You may obtain the latest binutils package through your normal
distribution channels or from:

http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/

TESTING THE FEC LIBRARY

After running the ./configure script, optional tests can be built and
run as follows:

make test

"make test" tests each routine, using the SIMD versions as
appropriate, verifying correct operation and estimating Viterbi
decoding speeds. These tests should always succeed unless something is
broken.
