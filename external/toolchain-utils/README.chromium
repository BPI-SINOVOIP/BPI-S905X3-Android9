Description:
This contains scripts used to help maintain the toolchain.  These
include tools for downloading and building Chromium OS; building
custom versions of the toolchain inside Chromium OS; launching
performance tests, analyzing the results and generating reports;
running toolchain regression tests; and using binary search to isolate
toolchain issues.

NOTE:  These tools are strictly for Chromium developers; none of them
ship on the final product (devices that run Chromium OS).
