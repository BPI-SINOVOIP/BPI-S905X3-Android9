To use these experiment files, replace the board, remote and images
placeholders and run crosperf on them.

The final experiment file should look something like the following (but with 
different actual values for the fields):

board: lumpy
remote: 123.45.67.089

# Add images you want to test:
my_image {
  chromeos_image: /usr/local/chromeos/src/build/images/lumpy/chromiumos_test_image.bin
}

vanilla_image {
   chromeos_root: /usr/local/chromeos
   build: lumpy-release/R35-5672.0.0
}

# Paste experiment benchmarks here. Example, I pasted
# page_cycler_v2.morejs here.

# This experiment just runs a short autotest which measures the performance of
# Telemetry's page_cycler_v2.morejs. In addition, it profiles

perg_args: record -e cycles

benchmark: page_cycler_v2.morejs {
   suite: telemetry_Crosperf
   iterations: 1
}
