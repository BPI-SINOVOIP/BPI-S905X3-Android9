# This example experiment file shows how to run a Telemetry test
# directly, bypassing autotest.  This runs the "run_measurement"
# script.  You need to supply both the name of the Telemetry test and
# the page_set (via the test_args argument).
#
# You should replace all the placeholders, marked by angle-brackets,
# with the appropriate actual values.

# Note:  You can specify multiple remotes, to run your tests in parallel on
# multiple machines. e.g. "remote: test-machine-1.com test-machine2.come
# test-machine3.com"
remote: <your-remote-goes-here>

# Replace "page_cycler_dhtml" below with the name of the Telemetry test
# that you want run_measurement to run.  Also replace the page set below
# (in the test_args field) with the appropriate page set for your test.
# N.B.  The key to running telemetry without autotest is the 'suite' field.
# Make sure your suite is 'telemtry', NOT 'telemetry_Crosperf'.
