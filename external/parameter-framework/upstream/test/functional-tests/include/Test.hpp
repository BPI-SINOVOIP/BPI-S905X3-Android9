 * When testing code it is often useful to have an list of possible
 * values and run the test for each of them.
 * This class represents one element of this list. For the complete list
 * see Tests.
 *
 * Catch has no build-in support for such need
 * (in fact it has but it is still experimental, look for "generators")
 * but it can be emulated with a loop over Tests.
 *
 * Each Test MUST specify a unique title, Ie all titles of a Tests MUST
 * be different. This is dued to the way that catch detects that a SECTION
 * has already been run. For more explanation see Tests.

/** Use a vector to represent a collection of test input.
 *
 * This type is designed to be used to parametrize tests.
 * Use it as follow:
 *     for (auto &test : Tests<std::string>{
 *     //                      ^~~~~~~~~~~ Test parameter type
 *             {"an invalid tag", "<invalid tag\"/> "},
 *           //^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Test parameters
 *             {"an unknown tag", "<unknown_tag/>"},
 *           // ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Unique title across the tests
 *             {"an unclosed tag", "<unclosed>"} }) {
 *           //                    ^~~~~~~~~~~ Value to test
 *         SECTION("Testing: " + test.title) {
 *         //                     ^~~~~~~~~~ Section title MUST unique
 *            test.payload //< value to test
 *            REQUIRE(getTag() != test.payload); // Example
 *            ...

 *
 *
 * Beware that if Value is not copyable, only movable this will
 * fail to compile as initializer_list does not support move semantic
 * (lets hope it will be fix in C++17).
 *
 * If a new test vector needs to support move, define:
 *     template <class Value>
 *     using MovableTests = Test<value>[];
 * This could be the default but VS2013 does not support it.
 * VS requires that an array size be defined. Thus define
 *     template <class Value, size_t size>
 *     using MovableTests = Test<value>[size];
 * will fix the VS compilation. Nevertheless this means that
 * all move only test vector will need to specify their size
 * which is redondant.
 * This is why it is not the default.
 * Hopefully it will be when VS will support deducing the size.
