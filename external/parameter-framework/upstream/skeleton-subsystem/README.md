# Skeleton plugin

This is a skeleton plugin i.e. the minimal plugin boilerplate.

It adds an `owner` and `message` mapping key and print it when reading or
writing the parameter.

## Usage

It has no purpose: it only serves as a template and the `make install` target
does not install it.  If you want to see a real-life plugin and makefiles, see
<https://github.com/01org/parameter-framework-plugins-alsa>  or
<https://github.com/01org/parameter-framework-plugins-filesystem> instead.
