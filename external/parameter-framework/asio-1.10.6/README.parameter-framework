This version of ASIO has been minified for lower disk footprint for Android
integraton by support/android/asio/asio_shrinker.sh.

Although unlikely (thanks to having been tested on all AOSP lunch targets), if
the Parameter Framework fails to compile on your lunch target because of a
missing ASIO header, you may download a vanilla ASIO version from
'http://sourceforge.net/projects/asio/files/asio/1.10.6%20%28Stable%29/' and
run that script anew.
