RELATION TO LIBPTP2
-------------------

Parts of libptp2 are copied (and modified) from version 1.1.0:

ptp-pack.c
ptp-pack.h
ptp.c
ptp.h

These are just copies of the same files from libptp2.
In order to avoid clashes with the libptp2 endianness scripts
we have named libptp-endian.h and libptp-stdint.h the
same way as in libptp2, though they are created by libmtp
autoconfigure scripts.

We will try to track libptp2 and fold changes back into
libmtp.

TODO: check if the following still holds! (Linus)

I have changed the config script slightly for the le64atoh function 
in libptp-endian.h. This is required for OS X on PowerPC (not sure why). 
I've just cast the bytes to uint64_t to avoid shifting wrongly.
