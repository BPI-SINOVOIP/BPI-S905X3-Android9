This directory contains tools for ICU updates.

Data update tools
=================

updateicudata.py
  - regerates the ICU data files.
    ICU and CTS tests for libcore should be run before and
    after.

See $ANDROID_BUILD_TOP/system/timezone for tools related to time zone updates.

Source code updates
===================

The source code in android_icu4j is generated from the source code in icu4j.

Changes to upstream ICU4J can fall into one of three categories:

1) Back-ported upstream ICU patches or other ICU behavior changes made for Android that cannot be
upstreamed.
2) Mechanical changes related to ICU4J being repackaged on Android under android.icu, the exposure
of a subset of ICU in the Android SDK, or Android's platform or documentation build process.
3) JavaDoc patches to replace ICU documentation that is incorrect/confusing for Android developers.

Do not change the code in android_icu4j/src or android_icu4j/resources directly: instead you
change the icu4j source, the transformation rules used by currysrc or the javadoc patch files.

All changes made to icu4j should be accompanied by changes in android_icu4j and vice versa.

Regenerating android_icu4j
--------------------------

After making changes (described below) the source code can be regenerated using:

source build/envsetup.sh
lunch

cd external/icu/tools/srcgen
./generate_android_icu4j.sh

The code in android_icu4j will be regenerated and should contain the changes you made
in icu4j. Confirm the diffs are what you intended. Commit both at the same time.

Applying upstream and behavioral patches to ICU4J
-------------------------------------------------

Upstream patches and other code changes that modify ICU4J behavior are made in the icu4j
source code before android_icu4j is generated. Apply ICU patches as normal and confirm that the
ICU tests pass.

Modifying the code gen
----------------------

android_icu4j is initially generated using a Java tool found in tools/srcgen.

The "rules" that transform the source are configured in
src/main/java/com/android/icu4j/srcgen/Icu4jTransform.java.

Adding a Javadoc local patch
----------------------------

ICU4J has Javadoc patches specific to Android only and they can't be upstreamed.

To reduce the maintenance cost of reapplying these changes when we upgrade ICU we store the patches
in the javadoc_patches directory. The use of the patch command also helps detect when changes
have been made to the upstream documentation being replaced that might otherwise be missed.

Changes are stored in separate files, one for each source file. This avoids maintaining a monolithic
patch file.

Javadoc changes are applied by the generate_android_icu4j.sh script automatically during post-srcgen
step.

WARNING: DO NOT add any behavioral changes in these patches. Behavioral code changes should be made
to icu4j directly.

To add a new Javadoc local patch:

1. Run ./generate_android_icu4j.sh
2. Use your IDE to change the required javadoc under android_icu4j
3. Run javadoc_patches/create_patches_i.sh
4. Run ./generate_android_icu4j.sh again

Re-generate all javadoc patches
-------------------------------

If you want to regenerate all of the Javadoc patch files you can do so by running:

./javadoc_patches/create_patches.sh
