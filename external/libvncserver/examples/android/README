This example VNC server for Android is adopted from
http://code.google.com/p/android-vnc-server/ with some additional
fixes applied.

To build, you'll need the Android Native Development Kit from
http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/.


Building with autotools
-----------------------

This has the advantage that the LibVNCServer sources are properly set up
using the configure script.

1. Read <NDK location>/docs/STANDALONE-TOOLCHAIN.html.

2. Setup your toolchain according to step 3 in the above file.

3. Execute 

    ./configure --host=arm-eabi CC=arm-linux-androideabi-gcc

   in the LibVNCServer root directory.

4. Execute

    make

   in the LibVNCServer root directory. This will build the whole
   LibVNCServer distribution for Android, including androidvncserver.




Building with the NDK build system
----------------------------------

This is probably easier than the autotools method, but you'll have to edit
some files manually.

1. Edit rfb/rfbconfig.h to match your Android target. For instance, comment out
   LIBVNCSERVER_HAVE_LIBJPEG if you don't have libjpeg for Android.

2. Edit the HAVE_X variables in jni/Android.mk accordingly.

3. Execute

    ndk-build -C .

   in the examples/android directory. The resulting binary will be in libs/.



Installing && Running
---------------------

This can be done via

 adb push androidvncserver /data/local/
 adb shell /data/local/androidvncserver
