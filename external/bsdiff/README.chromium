Description:

Binary diff/patch utility.

bsdiff and bspatch are tools for building and applying patches to binary
files. By using suffix sorting and taking advantage of how executable files
change, bsdiff routinely produces binary patches 50-80% smaller than those
produced by Xdelta, and 15% smaller than those produced by .RTPatch.
