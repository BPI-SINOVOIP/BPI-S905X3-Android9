Description:
This tool produces an ABI dump of a C/C++ library. This ABI dump can be used by
abi-compliance-checker in order to check ABI compliance with another version of
the library.

Local Modifications:
Add command-line options to specify paths to objdump, g++ and readelf. Also,
modify abi-dumper.pl to parse readelf's output instead of eu-readelf. eu-readelf
is not available as a prebuilt whereas readelf is. Modifications to enable usage
of custom vtable dumepr. Give +x permissions to abi-dumper.pl .
