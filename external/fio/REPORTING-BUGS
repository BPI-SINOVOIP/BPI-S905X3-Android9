Reporting a bug
---------------

If you notice anything that seems like a fio bug, please do send email
to the list (fio@vger.kernel.org, see README) about it. If you are not
running the newest release of fio, upgrading first is recommended.

When reporting a bug, you'll need to include:

1) A description of what you think the bug is
2) Environment (Linux distro version, kernel version). This is mostly
   needed if it's a build bug.
3) The output from fio --version.
4) How to reproduce. Please include a full list of the parameters
   passed to fio and the job file used (if any).

A bug report can never have too much information. Any time information
is left out and has to be asked for, it'll add to the turn-around time
of getting to the bottom of it and committing a fix.

That's it!
