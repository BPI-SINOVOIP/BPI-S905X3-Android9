// Helper class to create and synchronize access to an Android SurfaceTexture.
// It is used for creating webrtc::VideoFrameBuffers from a SurfaceTexture when
// the SurfaceTexture has been updated.
// When the VideoFrameBuffer is released, this class returns the buffer to the
// java SurfaceTextureHelper so it can be updated safely. The VideoFrameBuffer
// can be released on an arbitrary thread.
// SurfaceTextureHelper is reference counted to make sure that it is not
// destroyed while a VideoFrameBuffer is in use.
// This class is the C++ counterpart of the java class SurfaceTextureHelper.
// Usage:
// 1. Create an java instance of SurfaceTextureHelper.
// 2. Create an instance of this class.
// 3. Register a listener to the Java SurfaceListener and start producing
// new buffers.
// 4. Call CreateTextureFrame to wrap the Java texture in a VideoFrameBuffer.
