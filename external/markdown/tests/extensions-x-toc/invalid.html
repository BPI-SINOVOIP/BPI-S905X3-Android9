<h2 id="toc">[TOC]</h2>
<h1 id="header-1">Header 1</h1>
<p>The TOC marker cannot be inside a header. This test makes sure markdown doesn't 
crash when it encounters this  errant syntax. The unexpected output should
clue the author in that s/he needs to add a blank line between the TOC and
the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>.</p>
