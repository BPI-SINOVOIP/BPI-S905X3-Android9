  Correct case-mismatch in include guard.

include/cblas_f77.h
testing/cblas_test.h
  Rename xerbla_ to cblas_f77_xerbla_, to avoid collisions with the xerbla_
  exported by LAPACK.

testing/cblas_test.h
  Rename cblas_f77_xerbla_ back to xerbla_; in tests, we _do_ want to override
  the xerbla_ exported by LAPACK to capture the error.

  Replace Fortran wrappers either with calls to the Eigen "subroutine" versions
  for functions that return complex values, or with calls to the standard
  "function" versions for functions that return real values.  Delete unsupported
  variants from cblas_f77.h.
