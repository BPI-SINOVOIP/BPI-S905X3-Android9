Building the Chromium-based WebView in AOSP is no longer supported. WebView can
now be built entirely from the Chromium source code.

General instructions for building WebView from Chromium:
https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/build-instructions-android-webview

------

The prebuilt libwebviewchromium.so included in these APKs is built from Chromium
release tag 61.0.3163.98, using the GN build tool. To match our build settings, set:

target_os="android"
is_debug=false
is_official_build=true
is_chrome_branded=false
use_official_google_api_keys=false
exclude_unwind_tables=true
enable_resource_whitelist_generation=true
ffmpeg_branding="Chrome"
proprietary_codecs=true
enable_remoting=true

in your GN argument file before building.

------

Due to WebView API changes in the O-MR1 release, the Java code in the Chromium
3163 branch is not compatible with O-MR1. We'll be working on upstreaming
the O-MR1 specific Java changes to Chromium once the final O-MR1 SDK is released.
