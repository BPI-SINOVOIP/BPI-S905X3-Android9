/**
 * Contains dummy collection implementations to convince GWT that part of
 * serializing a collection is serializing its elements.
 *
 * <p>Because of our use of final fields in our collections, GWT's normal
 * heuristic for determining which classes might be serialized fails. That
 * heuristic is, roughly speaking, to look at each parameter and return type of
 * each RPC interface and to assume that implementations of those types might be
 * serialized. Those types have their own dependencies -- their fields -- which
 * are analyzed recursively and analogously.
 *
 * <p>For classes with final fields, GWT assumes that the class itself might be
 * serialized but doesn't assume the same about its final fields. To work around
 * this, we provide dummy implementations of our collections with their
 * dependencies as non-final fields. Even though these implementations are never
 * instantiated, they are visible to GWT when it performs its serialization
 * analysis, and it assumes that their fields may be serialized.
 *
 * <p>Currently we provide dummy implementations of all the immutable
 * collection classes necessary to support declarations like
 * {@code ImmutableMultiset<String>} in RPC interfaces. Support for
 * {@code ImmutableMultiset} in the interface is support for {@code Multiset},
 * so there is nothing further to be done to support the new collection
 * interfaces. It is not support, however, for an RPC interface in terms of
 * {@code HashMultiset}. It is still possible to send a {@code HashMultiset}
 * over GWT RPC; it is only the declaration of an interface in terms of
 * {@code HashMultiset} that we haven't tried to support. (We may wish to
 * revisit this decision in the future.)
