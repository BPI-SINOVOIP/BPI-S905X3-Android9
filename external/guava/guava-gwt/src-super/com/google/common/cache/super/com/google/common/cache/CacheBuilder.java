/**
 * <p>A builder of {@link LoadingCache} and {@link Cache} instances having any combination of the
 * following features:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>automatic loading of entries into the cache
 * <li>least-recently-used eviction when a maximum size is exceeded
 * <li>time-based expiration of entries, measured since last access or last write
 * <li>keys automatically wrapped in {@linkplain WeakReference weak} references
 * <li>values automatically wrapped in {@linkplain WeakReference weak} or
 *     {@linkplain SoftReference soft} references
 * <li>notification of evicted (or otherwise removed) entries
 * <li>accumulation of cache access statistics
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These features are all optional; caches can be created using all or none of them. By default
 * cache instances created by {@code CacheBuilder} will not perform any type of eviction.
 *
 * <p>Usage example: <pre>   {@code
 *
 *   LoadingCache<Key, Graph> graphs = CacheBuilder.newBuilder()
 *       .maximumSize(10000)
 *       .expireAfterWrite(10, TimeUnit.MINUTES)
 *       .removalListener(MY_LISTENER)
 *       .build(
 *           new CacheLoader<Key, Graph>() {
 *             public Graph load(Key key) throws AnyException {
 *               return createExpensiveGraph(key);
 *             }
 *           });}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Or equivalently, <pre>   {@code
 *
 *   // In real life this would come from a command-line flag or config file
 *   String spec = "maximumSize=10000,expireAfterWrite=10m";
 *
 *   LoadingCache<Key, Graph> graphs = CacheBuilder.from(spec)
 *       .removalListener(MY_LISTENER)
 *       .build(
 *           new CacheLoader<Key, Graph>() {
 *             public Graph load(Key key) throws AnyException {
 *               return createExpensiveGraph(key);
 *             }
 *           });}</pre>
 *
 * <p>The returned cache is implemented as a hash table with similar performance characteristics to
 * {@link ConcurrentHashMap}. It implements all optional operations of the {@link LoadingCache} and
 * {@link Cache} interfaces. The {@code asMap} view (and its collection views) have <i>weakly
 * consistent iterators</i>. This means that they are safe for concurrent use, but if other threads
 * modify the cache after the iterator is created, it is undefined which of these changes, if any,
 * are reflected in that iterator. These iterators never throw {@link
 * ConcurrentModificationException}.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> by default, the returned cache uses equality comparisons (the
 * {@link Object#equals equals} method) to determine equality for keys or values. However, if
 * {@link #weakKeys} was specified, the cache uses identity ({@code ==})
 * comparisons instead for keys. Likewise, if {@link #weakValues} or {@link #softValues} was
 * specified, the cache uses identity comparisons for values.
 *
 * <p>Entries are automatically evicted from the cache when any of
 * {@linkplain #maximumSize(long) maximumSize}, {@linkplain #maximumWeight(long) maximumWeight},
 * {@linkplain #expireAfterWrite expireAfterWrite},
 * {@linkplain #expireAfterAccess expireAfterAccess}, {@linkplain #weakKeys weakKeys},
 * {@linkplain #weakValues weakValues}, or {@linkplain #softValues softValues} are requested.
 *
 * <p>If {@linkplain #maximumSize(long) maximumSize} or
 * {@linkplain #maximumWeight(long) maximumWeight} is requested entries may be evicted on each cache
 * modification.
 *
 * <p>If {@linkplain #expireAfterWrite expireAfterWrite} or
 * {@linkplain #expireAfterAccess expireAfterAccess} is requested entries may be evicted on each
 * cache modification, on occasional cache accesses, or on calls to {@link Cache#cleanUp}. Expired
 * entries may be counted by {@link Cache#size}, but will never be visible to read or write
 * operations.
 *
 * <p>If {@linkplain #weakKeys weakKeys}, {@linkplain #weakValues weakValues}, or
 * {@linkplain #softValues softValues} are requested, it is possible for a key or value present in
 * the cache to be reclaimed by the garbage collector. Entries with reclaimed keys or values may be
 * removed from the cache on each cache modification, on occasional cache accesses, or on calls to
 * {@link Cache#cleanUp}; such entries may be counted in {@link Cache#size}, but will never be
 * visible to read or write operations.
 *
 * <p>Certain cache configurations will result in the accrual of periodic maintenance tasks which
 * will be performed during write operations, or during occasional read operations in the absence of
 * writes. The {@link Cache#cleanUp} method of the returned cache will also perform maintenance, but
 * calling it should not be necessary with a high throughput cache. Only caches built with
 * {@linkplain #removalListener removalListener}, {@linkplain #expireAfterWrite expireAfterWrite},
 * {@linkplain #expireAfterAccess expireAfterAccess}, {@linkplain #weakKeys weakKeys},
 * {@linkplain #weakValues weakValues}, or {@linkplain #softValues softValues} perform periodic
 * maintenance.
 *
 * <p>The caches produced by {@code CacheBuilder} are serializable, and the deserialized caches
 * retain all the configuration properties of the original cache. Note that the serialized form does
 * <i>not</i> include cache contents, but only configuration.
 *
 * <p>See the Guava User Guide article on <a href=
 * "http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/CachesExplained">caching</a> for a higher-level
 * explanation.

   * higher value than you need can waste space and time, and a significantly lower value can lead
   * to thread contention. But overestimates and underestimates within an order of magnitude do not
   * usually have much noticeable impact. A value of one permits only one thread to modify the cache
   * at a time, but since read operations and cache loading computations can proceed concurrently,
   * this still yields higher concurrency than full synchronization.
   *
   * <p> Defaults to 4. <b>Note:</b>The default may change in the future. If you care about this

   * granularity. For example, access queues and write queues are kept per segment when they are
