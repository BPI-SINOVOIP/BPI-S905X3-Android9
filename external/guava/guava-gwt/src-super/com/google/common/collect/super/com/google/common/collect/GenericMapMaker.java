/**
 * A class exactly like {@link MapMaker}, except restricted in the types of maps it can build.
 * For the most part, you should probably just ignore the existence of this class.
 *
 * @param <K0> the base type for all key types of maps built by this map maker
 * @param <V0> the base type for all value types of maps built by this map maker
 * @author Kevin Bourrillion
 * @since 7.0
 * @deprecated This class existed only to support the generic paramterization necessary for the
 *     caching functionality in {@code MapMaker}. That functionality has been moved to {@link
 *     com.google.common.cache.CacheBuilder}, which is a properly generified class and thus needs no
 *     "Generic" equivalent; simple use {@code CacheBuilder} naturally. For general migration
 *     instructions, see the <a
 *     href="http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/MapMakerMigration">MapMaker Migration
 *     Guide</a>.
