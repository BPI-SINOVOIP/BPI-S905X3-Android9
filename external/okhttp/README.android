Local patches
-------------

Addition of classes in android/ :
  - com.squareup.okhttp.internal.Platform - to replace the Platform class that
    comes with okhttp. Avoids use of reflection where possible.
  - com.squareup.okhttp.Http(s)Handler - integration with Android's corelibs.
  - com.squareup.okhttp.ConfigAwareConnectionPool - support for a
    ConnectionPool that listens for network configuration changes.
  - com.squareup.okhttp.internal.Version - a hand-crafted version of
    okhttp/src/main/java-templates/com/squareup/okhttp/internal/Version.java
    for Android.

All source changes (besides imports) marked with ANDROID-BEGIN and ANDROID-END:
  - Commenting of code that references APIs not present on Android.
  - @Ignore or comment out tests for functionality not supported on Android.
  - Work around JUnit 4.11 not being available on Android by adding a
    assertNotEquals() method to affect tests.

okio/ contains a snapshot of the Okio project. See okio/README.android for
