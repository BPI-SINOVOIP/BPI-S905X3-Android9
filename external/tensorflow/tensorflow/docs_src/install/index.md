# Installing TensorFlow

We've built and tested TensorFlow on the following 64-bit laptop/desktop
operating systems:

  * MacOS X 10.11 (El Capitan) or later.
  * Ubuntu 16.04 or later
  * Windows 7 or later.

Although you might be able to install TensorFlow on other laptop or desktop
systems, we only support (and only fix issues in) the preceding configurations.

The following guides explain how to install a version of TensorFlow
that enables you to write applications in Python:

  * @{$install_linux$Installing TensorFlow on Ubuntu}
  * @{$install_mac$Installing TensorFlow on macOS}
  * @{$install_windows$Installing TensorFlow on Windows}
  * @{$install_sources$Installing TensorFlow from Sources}

Many aspects of the Python TensorFlow API changed from version 0.n to 1.0.
The following guide explains how to migrate older TensorFlow applications
to Version 1.0:

  * @{$migration$Transitioning to TensorFlow 1.0}

The following guides explain how to install TensorFlow libraries for use in
other programming languages. These APIs are aimed at deploying TensorFlow
models in applications and are not as extensive as the Python APIs.

  * @{$install_java$Installing TensorFlow for Java}
  * @{$install_c$Installing TensorFlow for C}
  * @{$install_go$Installing TensorFlow for Go}
