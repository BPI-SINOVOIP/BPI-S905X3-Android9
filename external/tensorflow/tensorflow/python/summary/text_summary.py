"""Implements text_summary in TensorFlow, with TensorBoard support.

The text_summary is a wrapper around the generic tensor_summary that takes a
string-type tensor and emits a TensorSummary op with SummaryMetadata that
notes that this summary is textual data for the TensorBoard text plugin.

  """Summarizes textual data.

  Text data summarized via this plugin will be visible in the Text Dashboard
  in TensorBoard. The standard TensorBoard Text Dashboard will render markdown
  in the strings, and will automatically organize 1d and 2d tensors into tables.
  If a tensor with more than 2 dimensions is provided, a 2d subarray will be
  displayed along with a warning message. (Note that this behavior is not
  intrinsic to the text summary api, but rather to the default TensorBoard text
  plugin.)

  Args:
    name: A name for the generated node. Will also serve as a series name in
      TensorBoard.
    tensor: a string-type Tensor to summarize.
    collections: Optional list of ops.GraphKeys.  The collections to add the
      summary to.  Defaults to [_ops.GraphKeys.SUMMARIES]

  Returns:
    A TensorSummary op that is configured so that TensorBoard will recognize
    that it contains textual data. The TensorSummary is a scalar `Tensor` of
    type `string` which contains `Summary` protobufs.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If tensor has the wrong type.
