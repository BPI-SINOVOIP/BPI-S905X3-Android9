   Usually the operation is performed in the filter/channel dimension. This can

   Arguments:
   inputs: Tensor input
   num_units: Specifies how many features will remain after maxout in the `axis`
     dimension
         (usually channel). This must be multiple of number of `axis`.
   axis: The dimension where max pooling will be performed. Default is the
   last dimension.
