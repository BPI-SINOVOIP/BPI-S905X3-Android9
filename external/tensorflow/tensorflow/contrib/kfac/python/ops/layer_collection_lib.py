"""Registry for layers and their parameters/variables.

This represents the collection of all layers in the approximate Fisher
information matrix to which a particular FisherBlock may belong. That is, we
might have several layer collections for one TF graph (if we have multiple K-FAC
optimizers being used, for example.)
