# Eager Execution

> *WARNING*: This is a preview/pre-alpha version. The API and performance
> characteristics are subject to change.

Eager execution is an experimental interface to TensorFlow that provides an
imperative programming style (Ã  la [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org)). When you
enable eager execution, TensorFlow operations execute immediately; you do not
execute a pre-constructed graph with
[`Session.run()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Session).

For example, consider a simple computation in TensorFlow:

```python
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[1, 1])
m = tf.matmul(x, x)

with tf.Session() as sess:
  print(sess.run(m, feed_dict={x: [[2.]]}))

# Will print [[4.]]
```

Eager execution makes this much simpler:

```python
x = [[2.]]
m = tf.matmul(x, x)

print(m)
```

## Caveats

This feature is in early stages and work remains to be done in terms of smooth
support for distributed and multi-GPU training and CPU performance.
