class StructuralEnsembleRegressor(StateSpaceRegressor):
  """An Estimator for structural time series models.

  "Structural" refers to the fact that this model explicitly accounts for
  structure in the data, such as periodicity and trends.

  `StructuralEnsembleRegressor` is a state space model. It contains components
  for modeling level, local linear trends, periodicity, and mean-reverting
  transients via a moving average component. Multivariate series are fit with
  full covariance matrices for observation and latent state transition noise,
  each feature of the multivariate series having its own latent components.

  Note that unlike `ARRegressor`, `StructuralEnsembleRegressor` is sequential,
  and so accepts variable window sizes with the same model.

  For training, `RandomWindowInputFn` is recommended as an `input_fn`. Model
  state is managed through `ChainingStateManager`: since state space models are
  inherently sequential, we save state from previous iterations to get
  approximate/eventual consistency while achieving good performance through
  batched computation.

  For evaluation, either pass a significant chunk of the series in a single
  window (e.g. set `window_size` to the whole series with
  `WholeDatasetInputFn`), or use enough random evaluation iterations to cover
  several passes through the whole dataset. Either method will ensure that stale
  saved state has been flushed.

    """Initialize the Estimator.

    Args:
      periodicities: The expected periodicity of the data (for example 24 if
          feeding hourly data with a daily periodicity, or 60 * 24 if feeding
          minute-level data with daily periodicity). Either a scalar or a
          list. This parameter can be any real value, and does not control the
          size of the model. However, increasing this without increasing
          `num_values_per_cycle` will lead to smoother periodic behavior, as the
          same number of distinct values will be cycled through over a longer
          period of time.
      num_features: The dimensionality of the time series (one for univariate,
          more than one for multivariate).
      cycle_num_latent_values: Along with `moving_average_order` and
          `num_features`, controls the latent state size of the model. Square
          matrices of size `num_features * (moving_average_order +
          cycle_num_latent_values + 3)` are created and multiplied, so larger
          values may be slow. The trade-off is with resolution: cycling between
          a smaller number of latent values means that only smoother functions
          can be modeled.
      moving_average_order: Controls model size (along with
          `cycle_num_latent_values` and `autoregressive_order`) and the number
          of steps before transient deviations revert to the mean defined by the
          period and level/trend components.
      autoregressive_order: Each contribution from this component is a linear
          combination of this many previous contributions. Also helps to
          determine the model size. Learning autoregressive coefficients
          typically requires more steps and a smaller step size than other
          components.
      exogenous_feature_columns: A list of tf.contrib.layers.FeatureColumn
          objects (for example tf.contrib.layers.embedding_column) corresponding
          to exogenous features which provide extra information to the model but
          are not part of the series to be predicted. Passed to
          tf.contrib.layers.input_from_feature_columns.
      exogenous_update_condition: A function taking two Tensor arguments,
          `times` (shape [batch size]) and `features` (a dictionary mapping
          exogenous feature keys to Tensors with shapes [batch size, ...]), and
          returning a boolean Tensor with shape [batch size] indicating whether
          state should be updated using exogenous features for each part of the
          batch. Where it is False, no exogenous update is performed. If None
          (default), exogenous updates are always performed. Useful for avoiding
          "leaky" frequent exogenous updates when sparse updates are
          desired. Called only during graph construction. See the "known
          anomaly" example for example usage.
      dtype: The floating point data type to compute with. float32 may be
        faster, but can be problematic for larger models and longer time series.
      anomaly_prior_probability: If not None, the model attempts to
          automatically detect and ignore anomalies during training. This
          parameter then controls the prior probability of an anomaly. Values
          closer to 0 mean that points will be discarded less frequently. The
          default value (None) means that anomalies are not discarded, which may
          be slightly faster.
      optimizer: The optimization algorithm to use when training, inheriting
          from tf.train.Optimizer. Defaults to Adam with step size 0.02.
