  """Estimate a lower bound on effective sample size for each independent chain.

  Roughly speaking, "effective sample size" (ESS) is the size of an iid sample
  with the same variance as `state`.

  More precisely, given a stationary sequence of possibly correlated random
  variables `X_1, X_2,...,X_N`, each identically distributed ESS is the number
  such that

  ```Variance{ N**-1 * Sum{X_i} } = ESS**-1 * Variance{ X_1 }.```

  If the sequence is uncorrelated, `ESS = N`.  In general, one should expect
  `ESS <= N`, with more highly correlated sequences having smaller `ESS`.

  #### Example of using ESS to estimate standard error.

  ```
  tfd = tf.contrib.distributions
  tfb = tf.contrib.bayesflow

  target = tfd.MultivariateNormalDiag(scale_diag=[1., 2.])

  # Get 1000 states from one chain.
  states = tfb.hmc.sample_chain(
      num_results=1000,
      target_log_prob_fn=target.log_prob,
      current_state=tf.constant([0., 0.]),
      step_size=0.05,
      num_leapfrog_steps=20,
      num_burnin_steps=200)
  states.shape
  ==> (1000, 2)

  ess = effective_sample_size(states)
  ==> Shape (2,) Tensor

  mean, variance = tf.nn.moments(states, axis=0)
  standard_error = tf.sqrt(variance / ess)
  ```

  Some math shows that, with `R_k` the auto-correlation sequence,
  `R_k := Covariance{X_1, X_{1+k}} / Variance{X_1}`, we have

  ```ESS(N) =  N / [ 1 + 2 * ( (N - 1) / N * R_1 + ... + 1 / N * R_{N-1}  ) ]```

  This function estimates the above by first estimating the auto-correlation.
  Since `R_k` must be estimated using only `N - k` samples, it becomes
  progressively noisier for larger `k`.  For this reason, the summation over
  `R_k` should be truncated at some number `filter_beyond_lag < N`.  Since many
  MCMC methods generate chains where `R_k > 0`, a reasonable critera is to
  truncate at the first index where the estimated auto-correlation becomes
  negative.

  The arguments `filter_beyond_lag`, `filter_threshold` are filters intended to
  remove noisy tail terms from `R_k`.  They combine in an "OR" manner meaning
  terms are removed if they were to be filtered under the `filter_beyond_lag` OR
  `filter_threshold` criteria.

  Args:
    states:  `Tensor` or list of `Tensor` objects.  Dimension zero should index
      identically distributed states.
    filter_threshold:  `Tensor` or list of `Tensor` objects.
      Must broadcast with `state`.  The auto-correlation sequence is truncated
      after the first appearance of a term less than `filter_threshold`.
      Setting to `None` means we use no threshold filter.  Since `|R_k| <= 1`,
      setting to any number less than `-1` has the same effect.
    filter_beyond_lag:  `Tensor` or list of `Tensor` objects.  Must be
      `int`-like and scalar valued.  The auto-correlation sequence is truncated
      to this length.  Setting to `None` means we do not filter based on number
      of lags.
    name:  `String` name to prepend to created ops.

  Returns:
    ess:  `Tensor` or list of `Tensor` objects.  The effective sample size of
      each component of `states`.  Shape will be `states.shape[1:]`.

  Raises:
    ValueError:  If `states` and `filter_threshold` or `states` and
      `filter_beyond_lag` are both lists with different lengths.

  """Gelman and Rubin's potential scale reduction factor for chain convergence.

  Given `N > 1` states from each of `C > 1` independent chains, the potential
  scale reduction factor, commonly referred to as R-hat, measures convergence of
  the chains (to the same target) by testing for equality of means.
  Specifically, R-hat measures the degree to which variance (of the means)
  between chains exceeds what one would expect if the chains were identically
  distributed.  See [1], [2].

  Some guidelines:

  * The initial state of the chains should be drawn from a distribution
    overdispersed with respect to the target.
  * If all chains converge to the target, then as `N --> infinity`, R-hat --> 1.
    Before that, R-hat > 1 (except in pathological cases, e.g. if the chain
    paths were identical).
  * The above holds for any number of chains `C > 1`.  Increasing `C` does
    improves effectiveness of the diagnostic.
  * Sometimes, R-hat < 1.2 is used to indicate approximate convergence, but of
    course this is problem depedendent.  See [2].
  * R-hat only measures non-convergence of the mean. If higher moments, or other
    statistics are desired, a different diagnostic should be used.  See [2].

  #### Examples

  Diagnosing convergence by monitoring 10 chains that each attempt to
  sample from a 2-variate normal.

  ```python
  tfd = tf.contrib.distributions
  tfb = tf.contrib.bayesflow

  target = tfd.MultivariateNormalDiag(scale_diag=[1., 2.])

  # Get 10 (2x) overdispersed initial states.
  initial_state = target.sample(10) * 2.
  ==> (10, 2)

  # Get 1000 samples from the 10 independent chains.
  chains_states, _ = tfb.hmc.sample_chain(
      num_results=1000,
      target_log_prob_fn=target.log_prob,
      current_state=initial_state,
      step_size=0.05,
      num_leapfrog_steps=20,
      num_burnin_steps=200)
  chains_states.shape
  ==> (1000, 10, 2)

  rhat = tfb.mcmc_diagnostics.potential_scale_reduction(
      chains_states, independent_chain_ndims=1)

  # The second dimension needed a longer burn-in.
  rhat.eval()
  ==> [1.05, 1.3]
  ```

  To see why R-hat is reasonable, let `X` be a random variable drawn uniformly
  from the combined states (combined over all chains).  Then, in the limit
  `N, C --> infinity`, with `E`, `Var` denoting expectation and variance,

  ```R-hat = ( E[Var[X | chain]] + Var[E[X | chain]] ) / E[Var[X | chain]].```

  Using the law of total variance, the numerator is the variance of the combined
  states, and the denominator is the total variance minus the variance of the
  the individual chain means.  If the chains are all drawing from the same
  distribution, they will have the same mean, and thus the ratio should be one.
