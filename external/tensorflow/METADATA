description:
    "TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation "
    "using data flow graphs. The graph nodes represent mathematical operations, "
    "while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) "
    "that flow between them. This flexible architecture lets you deploy "
    "computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile "
    "device without rewriting code. TensorFlow also includes TensorBoard, a "
    "data visualization toolkit. "
    " "
    "TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working "
    "on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research "
    "organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep "
    "neural networks research. The system is general enough to be applicable in "
    "a wide variety of other domains, as well."
