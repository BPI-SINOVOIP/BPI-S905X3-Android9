# Open Integration Issues

### bpf/

The bpf tests depend on the bpf and elf libraries, and several kernel
config options that are not required by Android.

### cpufreq/

Cpufreq is not required by Android.

### cpu-hotplug/

Cpu hotplug is not required by Android.

### filesystems/dnotify_test.c

This test has an endless loop in it. It is not currently run as part of the
kselftest suite.

### firmware/

These tests depend on a kernel module enabled by CONFIG_TEST_FIRMWARE, which is
not required by Android.

### ftrace/

Ftrace is a debug feature and not required by Android.

### gpio/

The gpio test requires a test kernel module and gpiolib, neither of which are
required by Android.

### ipc/

The ipc test requires CONFIG_EXPERT and CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE be enabled,
neither of which are required by Android.

### lib/

The lib/ tests rely on kernel modules enabled by CONFIG_TEST_PRINTF,
CONFIG_TEST_BITMAP, and CONFIG_PRIME_NUMBERS. None of these are required by
Android.

### media_tests/

The media_tests depend on /dev/mediaX and /dev/videoX files which may not be
present. They also require manual inspection of dmesg and are not part of
the normal kselftest suite.

### membarrier/

The membarrier test depends on CONFIG_EXPERT and CONFIG_MEMBARRIER being
enabled, neither of which are required by Android.

### memfd/

These tests depend on FUSE which is not present in Android.

### memory-hotplug/

Memory hotplug is not required by Android.

### mount/

The mount test depends on CONFIG_USER_NS which is not required by Android.

### mqueue/

These tests depend on -lrt and -lpopt which are not present in Android.

### net/

The test_bpf.sh test requires a kernel module enabled by CONFIG_TEST_BPF.
The netdevice.sh test operates on an ethernet interface.
The psock_fanout test depends on CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL which is not required on
Android.

### nsfs/

These tests depend on CONFIG_USER_NS and CONFIG_PID_NS, neither of which are
required by Android.

### ntb/

NTB (non-transparent bridge) is not required by Android.

### pstore/

Pstore is recommended, not required, for Android.

### ptp/

PTP support is not required by Android.

### sigaltstack/

This is a test for functionality that is not available in bionic (swapcontext()).

### static_keys/

This test depends on a kernel module enabled by CONFIG_TEST_STATIC_KEYS. This
kernel module is not required by Android.

### sync/

These tests verify the legacy sync API which is deprecated on Android.

### sysctl

This test depends on a kernel module enabled by CONFIG_TEST_SYSCTL. This kernel
module is not required by Android.

### timers/

The adjtick test adjusts the system time and takes 2 minutes.

The change_skew test takes too long to run as part of VTS.

The clocksource_switch test takes too long to run as part of VTS and also tries
all clocksources.

The freq_step test relies on clocks having a greater precision than what may be
available.

The leap-a-day test repeatedly modifies the system date in order to test leap
second behavior. This may disrupt the target environment.

The leapcrash test adjusts the system date and takes several minutes to run.

The mqueue_lat test relies on mq_* calls which are not present on Android.

The rtctest_setdate test modifies the RTC's time and date which may disrupt the
target environment.

The set-2038 test repeatedly sets the time in order to test edge cases. This
may disrupt the target enviornment. The test also takes a long time.

The set-tz test sets the timezone which may disrupt the target environment.

The skew_consistency test takes too long to run as part of VTS.

### user/

This test depends on a kernel module enabled by CONFIG_TEST_USER_COPY. This
kernel module is not required by Android.

### vm/

The hugepage-mmap, hugepage-shm, compaction, and map_hugetlb tests rely on
hugetlbfs/hugetlb page support which is not required by Android.

The userfaultfd test relies on the userfaultfd syscall which is not required by
Android.

### watchdog/

The watchdog test depends on CONFIG_WATCHDOG which is not required by Android.

### zram/

The zram test depends on CONFIG_ZSMALLOC and CONFIG_ZRAM which are not required
by Android.
