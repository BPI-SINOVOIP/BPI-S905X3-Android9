Some changes to kselftest are required to compile it for Android. Those which
have been made but not yet submitted upstream and merged back to this
repository are kept here to make future merges easier.

In cases where a commit touched both kselftest files and Android-specific
files, the full commit is reproduced here. In rebasing these commits during a
merge only the changes in the kselftest files should be re-applied.

Upstream Merge Procedure:
- Do a git merge of the upstream tag with the "ours" policy, dropping all
  upstream changes. Do not commit yet.
- Delete tools/testing/selftests and replace it with a copy from the upstream
  kernel at the same tag as used above.
- Apply the patches from this directory, making changes as required.
- Test on all supported kernel versions, ensuring that any tests currently
  enabled in VTS do not generate new failures.
- Commit the merge.
