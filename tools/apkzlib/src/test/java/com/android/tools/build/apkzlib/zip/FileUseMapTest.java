     * Verifies that as elements are added to the map, the performance of adding new elements
     * is not significantly downgraded. This test creates a map and does several runs until
     * a maximum is reached or a time limit is reached.
     *
     * <p>In each run, a random block is requested from the map with a random alignment and offset.
     * The time for each run is saved.
     *
     * <p>After all runs are completed, the average time of the first runs (the head time) and
     * the average time of the last runs (the tail time) is computed, as well as the average
     * time.
     *
     * <p>The test passes if the average tail set time is (1) at most twice as long as the average
     * and (2) is at most three times as long as the head set. This ensures that performance can
     * degrade somewhat as the file map size increases, but not too much.
