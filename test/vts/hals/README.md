The files and sub dirs under this dir contain test HAL modules that are functionally similar to the ones in the corresponding nexus device's HAL dirs but are compiled in a different way (e.g., with a post-compile-time instrumentation or direct source code instrumentation). Those instrumentations are mostly for the VTS's fuzzing and tracing-and-logging when such can't be done in a non-intrusive way.
