CTS Trade Federation
---------------------

CTS Trade Federation, cts-tradefed for short, is the next
generation test harness for CTS.

cts-tradefed is built on top of the Android Trade Federation test harness.

It works in a similar manner to the prior CTS harness, but supports some
advanced features such as:

  - modular, flexible extensible design. cts-tradefed can be extended to
support running CTS in a continuous test environment.
  - supports sharding a CTS test run across multiple devices in parallel
  - automatically continue a CTS test run on another device if connection
is lost

Configuring cts-tradefed
------------------------

1. Ensure 'adb' is in your current PATH. adb can be found in the
Android SDK available from http://developer.android.com

Example:
  PATH=$PATH:/home/myuser/android-sdk-linux_x86/platform-tools

2. Follow the 'Setting up your device' steps documented in the
CTS User Manual. The CTS User Manual can be downloaded at
http://source.android.com/compatibility/downloads.html

3. Connect the device to the host machine.

4. Ensure device is visible via 'adb devices'

Using cts-tradefed
-------------------

To run a test plan on a single device:

1. Make sure you have at least one device connected
2. Launch the cts-tradefed console by running the 'cts-tradefed'. If you've
downloaded and extracted the CTS zip, the script can be found at
  android-cts/tools/cts-tradefed
Or else if you are working from the Android source tree and have run make cts,
the script can be found at
  out/host/linux-x86/cts/android-cts/tools/cts-tradefed
3. Type:
'run cts' to run the default CTS plan

Some other useful commands are

To run a test module:
'run cts --module <module_name>'

To run a specific test:
'run cts --module <module_name> --test <test_name>'

To shard a plan test run on multiple devices
'run cts --shard-count <number of shards>
note: all connected devices must be running the same build

For more options:
'run cts --help'

CTS Tradefed Development
------------------------
See http://source.android.com for instructions on obtaining the Android
platform source code and setting up a build environment.

The source for the CTS extensions for tradefed can be found at
<android source root>/cts/tools/tradefed-host

The source for the tradefed framework can be found on the 'tradefed' branch.

Perform these steps to build and run cts-tradefed from the development
environment:
cd <path to android source root>
make cts
cts-tradefed

More documentation and details on using and extending trade federation will
be forthcoming in the near future.
